kannel (0.11.3.cvs-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version 0.11.3. This Debian package has a few additional
    changes made in upstream CVS since the release:
  * SMS timestamps are set by Kannel, if the SMS center did not set them.
  * Bugfixes in assertions.
  * Fixes to a couple of WMLScript compilation bugs.
  * WTP protocol fix in cases when load is heavy and Ack packets are delayed.
  * WTP state machine fix: if an event can't be handled, it is just ignored,
    instead of the state machine being killed.
  * Debian packaging: postinst creates user kannel, init.d/kannel runs
    the boxes as that user.

kannel (0.11.2.cvs-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated version of Debian packaging, for the CVS version. Also added
    a Debian revision number to the version number: even though the debian/
    directory is part of upstream sources, there may be several Debian
    versions due to packaging etc per upstream release.
