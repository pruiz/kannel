NEWS about Kannel: Open Source WAP and SMS Gateway version 0.10.1

This is a STABLE version. We will maintain it and make bugfix
releases until the next stable version, which will be numbered 0.12.
Please do try it out and report problems to devel@kannel.org (the 
development mailing list) or bugs@kannel.org (the bug tracking system).

Changes since version 0.10.1:

* Various bugfixes and memory leak fixes in wml compiler, sms-service 
  urltranslations and phone-as-smsc
 

Change summary from version 0.8:

* New HTTP implementation

* Wapbox mostly rewritten.  New version is closer to the standard,
  less buggy, and will be easier to improve further.

* All boxes now share a single configuration file, with a new format.

* New bearerbox, which is easier to expand and edit

* Connectionless mode for WAP browsing

* Phone-as-SMSC support, Nokia PremiCell, Siemens M20, Wavecom

* CIMD2 SMS center protocol. UDH works.

* WML compiler has support for 8-bit character sets that are not ISO 8859-1.

* WML compiler now uses the string table to compress its output, to generate
  smaller pages that fit in more phones.

* New test utility drive_wapbox, to test wapbox in isolation.

* New test utility test_cimd2, which emulates a CIMD2 server.

* WML decompiler provided by Vanteon, useful for testing WML compiler.

* contrib directory added. Now has a Perl script to convert HTML to WML.

* New gwlib wrapper for threads, both to encapsulate them for portability
  and to provide a "wakeup" feature whereby threads that are blocked or
  sleeping can be woken by other threads.  Will be used to improve the
  shutdown sequence in all boxes, and the suspend feature in the bearerbox.

* Improved portability to Solaris and FreeBSD.

* Experimental HTTP POST and cookies, under POST_SUPPORT and COOKIE_SUPPORT

* Bug fixes:

	* pthread errno handling.
	* WTP layer correctly sets retransmission flag.
	* fakewap: fixed tid handling.
	* wsp: corrected capability parsing
	* wsp: no more Tid-invoke problems
	* fixes to SMPP and EMI code

* Known problems:

	* wapbox shutdown sometimes gets stuck and requires kill -9.
	* HTTP library might get locked up for several minutes in certain 
	  environments
	* cimd2 cannot survive reconnect

* Known limitations:

	* wsp: missing Push and Suspend/Resume
