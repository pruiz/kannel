NEWS about Kannel: Open Source WAP and SMS Gateway version 0.9.1

This is a DEVELOPMENT version. It should be usable for experimentation
and testing but is not intended for production use.  Please do try it
out and report problems to devel@kannel.org (the development mailing list)
or bugs@kannel.org (the bug tracking system).

Change summary from version 0.8:

* New HTTP implementation.

* New, faster bearerbox.

* All boxes now share a single configuration file, with a new format.

* Wapbox mostly rewritten.  New version is closer to the standard,
  less buggy, and will be easier to improve further.

* CIMD2 SMS center protocol. UDH works.

* SEMA SMS center protocol: Fixes and updates from Hao Shi.

* WML compiler has support for 8-bit character sets that are not ISO 8859-1.

* WML compiler now uses the string table to compress its output, to generate
  smaller pages that fit in more phones.

* EMI implementation should support UDH now. Also, initialization of TRN
  fixed.

* New test utility drive_wapbox, to test wapbox in isolation.

* New test utility test_cimd2, which emulates a CIMD2 server.

* Octstr conversions between binary and base64.

* mutex_lock panics if it locks the same mutex twice. Needed for
  portability.

* smsbox_req.c uses Octstr's more than before, instead of C strings.

* gwlib now had gwlib_init and gwlib_shutdown, instead of having to
  call each library module init and shutdown separately.

* contrib directory added. Now has a Perl script to convert HTML to WML.

* configure option --enable-mutex-stats added, for logging mutex sleeps.

* New gwlib wrapper for sockets, to do high speed non-blocking I/O.
  Not in use yet.

* New gwlib wrapper for threads, both to encapsulate them for portability
  and to provide a "wakeup" feature whereby threads that are blocked or
  sleeping can be woken by other threads.  Will be used to improve the
  shutdown sequence in all boxes, and the suspend feature in the bearerbox.

* New approach for packing and unpacking WTP and WSP PDUs.

* Improved portability to Solaris and FreeBSD.

* Thread-safe wrappers around system library functions known to be not
  thread-safe.

* Bug fixes:

	* Memory leak when smscenter_receive_message fails.
	* gwmem-check.c does arithmetic with long* instead of void*.
	* list_destroy, conffile.c silently ignores NULL argument.
	* pthread errno handling.
	* log.c: pthread_self cast to long rather than int for printing.
	* wtp.c: memory leak fixed in tell_about_error.
	* wsp_http.c no longer crashes wapbox after every request.
	* WTP layer correctly sets retransmission flag.
	* CIMD2: handle text messages longer than 140 characters correctly.
	* fakewap: fixed tid handling.
	* http: header names are compared case-insensitively.
	* wsp: corrected capability parsing for Motorola Timeport.

* Known problems:

	* Still "cannot handle TR-Invoke.ind" in the logfiles.
	* drive_wapbox with more than 1 client crashes the wapbox
	  for some people.
	* "checking" memory allocator is slow; configure --with-malloc=native
	  if you want Kannel to handle more than three requests per second.
	* bearerbox/wapbox shutdown sometimes gets stuck and requires kill -9.
