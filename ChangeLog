    * gw/smsc/smsc_http.c: fixed alt-charset issue that we try to reencode even

    * gwlib/log.c: Comparing a va_list with NULL is bogus. It's supposed to be treated like
      an opaque type and only be manipulated with va_* accessors. This fixes #587.

    * applied patch that adds sqlite3 DB and DLR support. This patch was originally
      contributed by David Butler, posted 2009-11-23 to the list, with Msg-ID
      <22DE7AAC95BA4B5A9EEF3FEC90222162@VAIO>. Stipe added userguide parts and

2011-03-08 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/list.c: applied patch which fixes a rare memory leak.
      When the destroy is called, it extracts until a NULL is found, which may
      not necessarily be the last item in the list as gwlist allows you to add
      NULL items to it.
