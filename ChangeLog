    * changed validity and deferred fields to unix timestamp. Nothing changed
      for the external calls for smsbox.

2012-12-19 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/utils.c: fixed initgroups call. This fixes #676.
      Thanks to  Alexandr Ryabukhin for report.

2012-12-19 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/utils.c: applied patch that display compiled PostgreSQL version.
      Thanks to Alexey Savchuk <international at devpreview.ru> for this patch.

2012-12-19 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/gw-prioqueue.c, gwlib/gwthread-pthread.c, gwlib/list.c: fixed
      gwthread_cancel function. This commit fixes #667.

2012-10-31  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c: the sscanf() is NOT taking a POSIX regex pattern.
      The '^' chracter is NOT representing a "must start", but an "does not
      include". So the whole pattern refuses msg IDs that contain a 's'
      character. Fixed this to comply now with the real printf() semantics.
      This fixes bug #663. Thanks to Mark Poulsen for the bug report.
      
2012-10-19  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: add 'alt-charset' documentation for context
      'group = sms-service'.
    * gw/smsbox.c: adding the 'alt-charset' handling for sms-services, allowing
      an user to define an alternative character encoding then UTF-8 to be used
      while making HTTP calls to remote application systems. Most of the diff
      changes are source code re-formating. The essential logic changes are
      found at line 1112 for the MO handling, and at line 1693 for MT handling.
    * gw/urltrans.[ch]: added function urltrans_alt_charset() and corresponding
      element in the URLTranslation struct, keeping the config directive.
    * gwlib/cfg.def: added 'alt-charset' to 'group = sms-service' context. 
    This patchset implements feature Feature #661.
    
2012-10-19  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_fake.c: handled the msg->sms.coding types more adequate
      in function sms_to_client(), as most common terminals can display UTF-8.
            
2012-10-19  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_fake.c: add missing declaration of msg->sms.coding when
      an MO message is received and forwarded to the core layer.
      
2012-10-14  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: document that we can use SMPP v5.0 
      bind connections too now.
    * gw/smsc/smpp_pdu_opt.def: add the TLVs added in SMPP v5.0.
    * gw/smsc/smpp_pdu.def: add optional TLVs to the the SMPP v3.[3|4] PDUs
      and some new PDUs as defined in SMPP v5.0.
    * gw/smpp_pdu.h: added a couple of NPI values defined in SMPP v5.0.
    * gw/smsc_smpp.c: add basic support for SMPP v5.0 handling.
    This patchset incorporates the new parts from the SMPP v5.0 spec into
    the codebase, without being intrusive to the current default behaviour.
    
2012-10-14  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/http.[ch]: add function http_request_url() to gain access to
      the used URL of the transaction, i.e. this will be required for HTTP 
      RESTful implementations of OneAPI v2.0 in the SMSC HTTP module for 
      the receiving function callback to distinguish MO and DLRs.
      
2012-10-12  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide.xml: adding documentation part for new SMSC type 'GSMA 
      OneAPI v1.0 ParlayX SMS SOAP'.
    * gw/smscconn_p.h, gw/smscconn.c: add new SMSC type create function
      smsc_soap_parlayx_create(), depending on gSOAP support.
    * gw/smsc/smsc_soap_parlayx.c: implement two variants of 'smsc = parlayx',
      for the Ericsson SDP 'system-type = ericsson-sdp' and the GSMA OneAPI
      v1.0 'system-type = oneapi-v1', both based on ParlayX 2.1 SOAP service.
    * soap/Makefile.in: generic Makefile for SOAP services implemented via
      gSOAP created C headers and sources.
    * soap/service/parlayx/parlayx_sms_send_service_2_1_wrapper.h: wrapper
      for the gSOAP wsdl2h created header file, to include WS-Security via
      wsse imports.
    * soap/service/parlayx/typemap.dat: namespace mapping file for the service.
    * soap/service/parlayx/wsdl/*.[wsdl|xsd]: web service description language
      and extensible schema description files for this service.
    * configure[.in]: implement --with-gsoap[=DIR] to allow adding gSOAP 
      support for SOAP based services, i.e. for the ParlayX SMSC type.
    * gw-config.h.in: add define HAVE_GSOAP.
    * Makefile.in: set include marker for the soap/Makefile[.in] spin-off
      Makefile dedicated to the whole SOAP building framework.
    This patchset adds generic gSOAP support for building SOAP based SMS
    services into Kannel. As the first implementation, we provide ParlayX 2.1
    with the variants of the Ericsson SDP and the GSMA OneAPI v1.0. More
    SOAP based services can be implemented easily now.
    
2012-10-08  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide.xml: adding documentation part for new config directive
      'dead-start' being a global config directive for the 'group = smsc' 
      scope.
    * gw/bb_smscconn.c: use the dead_start flag in the connection struct to
      determine if we're connecting a SMSC or leave it in 'dead' mode.
    * gw/bearerbox.[ch]: changed prototype for smsc2_resume() to indicate a
      flag if it was/should be inited.
    * gw/smscconn_p.h: add dead_start flag to smscconn.
    * gw/smscconn.c: read the SMSC type generic 'dead-start' boolean config
      directive to determine if we are starting this SMSC connection type in
      a disconnected mode (dead).
    This patchset was originally provided by Alejandro Guerrieri.
    [Msg-Id: <DB023A11-9563-4F0B-A4CB-39A8E86DEE7B@kannel.org>]
    Thanks to Alejandro for the patchset, and Juan Nin for raising the topic.
      
2012-10-01  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/wap_push_pap_[compiler|mime].c: process the 'X-Wap-Application-Id'
      within the HTTP header of the payload content part of the multi-part
      MIME type, and NOT inside the meta-level HTTP headers.
    * test/test_pgg.c: ensure we inject the 'X-Wap-Application-Id' header
      to the correct section of the payload multi-part MIME type content.
    This patchset fixes bug #551 and has been confirmed in production.
    Thanks a lot to Nikolay Khrustalev and Rafael Aquino for reporting and
    providing analysis data to resolve the bug.

2012-09-26 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * test/fakesmsc.c: segmentation fault when the program reaches EOF.
      Thanks to Rudy Matela <rudy at matela.com.br> for this patch.

2012-09-26 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/http/generic.c: fixed segfault and mem leak.

2012-09-24  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c: reverting the last commit, since this has no logical
      effect in fact, due that ASCII is the first byte range in UTF-8 anyway.
      We get the same result, but still go throught the convert routine which
      can be considered overhead.
      Thanks to Alexander Malysh who pointed this out and voted for a revert.
      
2012-09-21  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c: fix missing conversion to internal encoding (UTF-8)
      if we receive IA5/ASCII payload content.
      Thanks to Donald Jackson <dj at kannel.org> for spotting this.
  
2012-08-31  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/dict.[ch]: added function dict_duplicate() allowing an easy
      logical content duplication of an existing Dict structure, added
      functions dict_traverse[_sorted]() which allow in Dict traversal without
      locking the Dict logically outside, before going into a traversal loop.
      The sorted version allows to pre-sort the data elements of the Dict
      via a custom sorting function, then traversing the elements in this
      sorted order.
      
2012-08-31 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/octstr.[ch]: added two new functions: octstr_str_search and octstr_str_rsearch.

2012-08-31 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_http.c: fixed segfault produced by last commit.

2012-08-29 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/http/*.c, gw/smsc/smsc_http.c: splitted HTTP SMSC submodules into files.
      This allow us to reduce code in HTTP SMSC itself and prepare this SMSC for
      dynamicaly loading of submodules.
      No behavior change in any implementation.

2012-08-22 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/octstr.c: replaced old hash funtion with hash from Robert Sedgewick.

2012-08-06 Andreas Fink <andreas at fink.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_at.c: fixed a bug which crashed bearerbox if no
      modem definition was used in the config.

2012-08-06  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * test/test_dict.c: add a second Dict to cross-key check, testing value
      consistancy.
      
2012-08-06  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/dlr_spool.c: reduce code complexity be re-using the essential parts.
    
2012-08-06  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * */*: updating the LICENSE preamble to reflect the correct year.
    
2012-08-06  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: add documentation about 'dlr-storage = spool'
    * gw/dlr_p.h: add dlr_init_spool() prototype.
    * gw/dlr_spool.c: implement a DLR storage using a spool directory. This
      uses either a SHA1 or MD5 hash representing the msg ID, adding a suffix
      of the destination address. When dlr_find() is called, we use the same
      heuristic approach to resolve the correct DLR message as in the internal
      DLR storage module.
    * gw/dlr.c: add initialization call to dlr_init_spool() if configured
      accordingly.
    * gwlib/cfg.def: add config directive 'dlr-spool' in the core group to let
      the user define which DLR storage spool location should be used.
    This patchset implements a simple, natively supported (no external libs)
    persistent DLR storage on the local file system using a spool directory.
    
2012-08-06  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * configure[.in], gw-config.h.in: add detection of POSIX.1 nftw() 
      availability.
    * test/test_file_traversal.c: file traversal test, using two different
      approaches to traverse a directory structure recursively.
    
2012-08-06  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * test/test_hash.c: simple test program replacing test_md5.c which
      computes both, MD5 hash digest and a SHA1 hash digest if openssl has
      been available.
      
2012-08-06  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * test/test_dict.c: add a lookup phase too, in order to have a populate
      and lookup phase while testing.
    
2012-07-17 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * README: applied patch that corrects docs build on current debian.
      Thanks to Martin Atukunda <matlads at gmail.com> for this patch.

2012-07-04  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * doc/CodingStyle: fix type for --pad-oper option. NLC.
     
2012-06-02  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/http.c: fix possible problems for HTTP/1.1 "Host" header value. We
      need to remove the port in both cases that contain the standard port
      values, port 80 for non-SSL and port 443 for SSL-enabled connections.
    
2012-05-31 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: removed meta-data from smsc group because it
      is not supported there.

2012-05-23 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c: added workaround for deferred=0.

2012-05-16 Andreas Fink <andreas at fink.org>
    * gw/smsc_at.c gw/smsc_at.h gwlib/cfg.def: implemented ability to disable
    hardware flow control from the computer side due to some broken modems
    who not simply ignore hardware flow control but actually wire it in the
    way that if its enabled, flow is always disabled. You can now
    say hardware-flow-control = 0 in the modem definition to let the computer
    ignore that fake signal. Note this is not the same as enable-hwhs which is the
    AT command to tell the modem to actually use flow control. hardware-flow-control
    is the hardware flow control for the computer side.

2012-04-20 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsbox.c: fixed issue with shut down of smsbox.

2012-04-19  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: adding documentation for escape code %x
      applicable for 'access-log-format' in the 'group = core' context.
    * gw/bb_alog.c: adding escape code %x for 'access-log-format' pattern
      handling, which substitutes to the smsbox-id. Reformated the function
      to comply with CodingStyle standards.
      
2012-04-08 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsbox.c: fixed double free bug for post request.
      Thanks to Bartlomiej Balcerek <Bartlomiej.Balcerek at pwr.wroc.pl>
      for bug report.

2012-04-06 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * doc/arch/arch.xml: fixed #354.

2012-04-06 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * doc/arch/arch.xml: fixed #355.

2012-04-06 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: fixed default source and destination addr
      ton. This fixes #636.

2012-03-28  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsbox.c: fix minor compiler warning. NLC.
    
2012-03-21 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_http.c, gwlib/cfg.def, doc/userguide/userguide.xml:
      added new option 'generic-param-dlr-err' to pass dlr-err for DLR.

2012-03-21 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_http.c: don't convert HTTP dlr errorcode as stated in SMPP
      spec because HTTP is not SMPP. Just pass dlr errorcode as is to smsbox
      in ?dlr? meta data group, similar to other smsc modules.

2012-03-21 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_http.c: request DLR also if conndata->dlr_url is set.

2012-03-21 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_http.c: write the whole URL, with query string by debugging.

2012-03-21 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/meta_data.h: added some defines to use for meta data.

2012-03-08  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/bb_boxc.c: fix MO routing logic implied by 'smsbox-route' context. We
      have been passing MOs that had a strict smsbox-id routing decission to
      an random not-identified smsbox if there was no smsbox-id connection.
      This breaks the MO routing criteria. Now we obey the smsbox-id routing
      decission and re-inject the MO message rather back to the main queue.
      This patchset fixes bug #633.
      
2012-03-07 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * contrib/kannel-monitor/index.php, contrib/kannel-monitor/xmltoarray.php:
      This patch adds replaces the <? to <?php to fully support when open tags
      are not configured. This patch fixes #250.
      Thanks to Renato Jop for this patch. 

2012-02-23 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * acinclude.m4, configure: added GIT version check

2012-02-21 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * test/test_http_server.c: allow define custom response headers.

2012-02-15  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_http.c: inject 'text' and username variables to DLR message
      passed back to a smsbox connection. This harmonizes the behaviour to be
      similar as for the SMPP client module part.
      
2012-02-08 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * wap/wtls_pdu.c: fixed possible segfault.
      Thanks to Armindo Antunes <armindo.antunes at gmail.com> for this patch.

2012-02-02 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/bb_smscconn.c: fixed bb_smscconn_send_failed for DLRs.

2012-01-25  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * configure: fixing autoconf generated script from Andreas, which breaks
      the 'config.nice' re-configuration handling. Seems to be the autoconf
      version related. NLC.

2012-01-24 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c: fixed compiler warnings

2012-01-16  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_[http|smpp].c: again, minor source code changes to follow
      our doc/CodingStyle rules! NLC.
      
2012-01-12 Andreas Fink <afink at smsrelay.com>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c: proper handling of network_error_code. Kannel assumed
      it was the same 3 characters as in the delivery report string but 
      spec says something else so its properly converted now. 
      Whitespace changes (removed tabs).
    * ChangeLog. Corrected Stipe's year

2012-01-07  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_http.c: slight code change from Andrea's previous commit. We
      don't need to allocate more variables on the stack as we have a temp 
      Ocstr* already. NLC.
      
2012-01-07 Andreas Fink <afink at smsrelay.com> 
    * gw/smsc/smsc_http.c: added new parameter for DLR named dlr-err which can
      contain a network error code which is parsed the same way the err: field
      in SMPP delivery reports are parsed.
    * configure[.in]: added support for MacOS X 10.7 Lion SDK.

2011-11-09 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/octstr.c, gwlib/octstr.c.debug: fixed segfault on some systems where
      long overflow occurs. This fixes #623.
      Thanks to Lutalo Joseph Willrich for patch.

2011-10-31 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * reverted commited that moved .foreign_id injection from dlr_add() because
      it breaks other SMSC module as SMPP.

2011-10-26 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * wmlscript/wsgram.y: fixed compilation error.

2011-10-13  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * configure[.in]: need to test for <sys/ucontext.h>, tbough it is defined 
      in IEEE Std 1003.1-2001/Cor 2-2004 it is not fully portable, i.e. OpenBSD
      and Cygwin lack the functionality.
    * gw-config.h.in: add HAVE_UCONTEXT macro.
    * gw/shared.c: add header include to fix implicite declaration warning. NLC.
    * gwlib/utils.c: include <sys/ucontext.h> only if the system has user 
      context support, fix minor compiler warning. 
      
2011-10-11 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/log.[ch], gwlib/utils.[ch]: extracted backtrace output into extra
      function. Added fatal signal handler in order to be able to trace segfaults.

2011-10-11  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c: moved .foreign_id injection from dlr_add() to the
      submit_sm_resp PDU handling code, otherwise we would ONLY see foreign IDs
      in the access-log IF DLR have been requested. Now we see them in any case.
    * gw/dlr.c: remove .foreign_id injection code in dlr_add(), due that this is
      the wrong place to do it. If the user didn't request a DLR, we still want
      to pickup the foreign ID and use it, at least in the access-log i.e.
    
2011-10-09 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c: fixed encoding of LATIN1 messages.
      This fixes #613.
      Thanks to Anders B for this patch.

2011-10-09 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsbox.c:: Set charset to UTF-8 for POST requests.
      This fixes #614.
      Thanks Anders B for the patch.

2011-10-09 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsbox.c: fixed double charset processing for POST requests.
      This fixes #615.

2011-10-09 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/bearerbox.c, gw/shared.[ch], gw/smsbox.c, gw/wapbox.c, gwlib/gwlib.[ch], gwlib/utils.c:
      This patch should fix issues with restart HTTP command.

2011-10-06  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_http.c: fix default DLR storing behaviour for 'generic' type.
      We shall always store the DLR temp data in a successful transmission,
      even if no 'generic-foreign-id-regex' is given. If it is given, then we
      try to regex scan it and use it for the DLR temp data, if not, then store
      our own UUID as reference ID of the message. This ensures generic behaves
      the same way as type kannel.

2011-09-30 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_at.c: fixed double reencoding issue when message retried
      again after the failure.

2011-09-14 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml, gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c, gwlib/cfg.def: applied
      patch that allows setting of esm_class in SMPP module.
      Thanks to Alan McNatty <alan at catalyst.net.nz> for the patch.

2011-09-13  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_http.c: fixed double hex encoding for system type 'kannel'
      and 'no-sep = yes'. Due that we manipulate the msg->sms.[udh|msg]data
      directly, and the msg is re-queued in case of a HTTP call failure we get
      perform the hex encoding again, which results in a truncated content.

2011-03-30 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * applied patch that fixes some issues for HTTP-SMSC:
      1) added support for max-pending-submits , so that we don't eat all our
         file descriptors if we have much traffic
      2) changed open_sends from long to Counter, avoid race conditions
      3) start new sender_thread because otherwise we are unable to limit max pending
         submits and if throughput is set we block the whole bearerbox instead of only
         one SMSC
      4) changed shutdown sequence to run safe in parallel

2011-03-30 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>

      function call switching via #if pre-processor macro so we choose either
      sqlite3_prepare_v2() if we do have a local sqlite3 version that supports
      it. This ensures we build again on CentOS 5.x ie.

    * gwlib/log.c: Comparing a va_list with NULL is bogus. It's supposed to be treated like

    * gwlib/list.c: applied patch which fixes a rare memory leak.
      When the destroy is called, it extracts until a NULL is found, which may
      not necessarily be the last item in the list as gwlist allows you to add
      NULL items to it.
