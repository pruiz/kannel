   * doc/userguide/userguide.xml, gw/smsbox.c: fixed userguide for XML post.
     Also fixed XML Post parsing of smsc-id to match userguide. It's possible
     that this will break existing applications.

2007-07-22 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
   * gw/ota_compiler.c: added new WLAN-related tokens in order to get new
     Nokia WiFi/VoIP OTA provisioning working. See OMA-DM-CP-2005-001R02-CR_CP-WLAN-.doc.
     This fixed #406.
     Thanks to sobomax for patch.

   * gw/smsc/smsc_at.c: set reconnecting = 1 if we have issues opening
     device. So we will sleep reconnect time instead of hammering on
     maybe not existing device. This should fix #412.

   * gw/dlr.h: fix bitmask for DLR_IS_NOT_FINAL macro, since DLR_SMSC_FAIL is
     a final state, we need to ommit it here to be semantically correct.

     as gwlist_consume except that we are able to specify timeout.

2007-04-24  Andreas Fink <andreas at fink.org>
   * gwlib/gwlib.c: call log_init before http_init and socket_init so error
     messages from those init calls actually are able to appear on the screen
     instead of crashing bearerbox at start. Reported under MacOS X by
     Alejandro Guerrieri. Only happened if hostname was not set.
     ERROR: Can't find out official hostname for this host, using `xyz' instead.

2007-04-20  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
   * aclocal.m4: fixed typo and updated email references. NLC.
   * Makefile.in: adding creation of symlink for 'gw-config' if we have used
     '--with-suffix' while configure, otherwise gw-config is also appended
     with suffix string and it does not comply with external components
     depending to find a 'gw-config' in the PATH and use the cflags and libs
     information for their own builds against Kannel libs. This is safe now
     for both, w/o suffix.

2007-04-16  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
   * gw/smsc/smsc_http.c: fixing default charset encoding policy in chaining
     Kannel instances via 'system-type = kannel'. As we use now UTF-8 as
     internal encoding, but still WINDOWS-1252 as default encoding for 
     smsbox's sendsms HTTP interace, we need to forward explicetly the CGI
     variable charset to the next instance here to let the smsbox know that
     we pass the message in UFT-8 format for normal text messages.
     This is a temporary issue, as long as smsbox's sendsms HTTP interface
     isn't switched to UTF-8, which we should do in next major revision.

2007-04-14  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
   * gwlib/octstr.c: imunize octstr_truncate() for NULL argument. Currently
     this would cause a panic when charset_utf8_to_gsm(NULL) is called. Now
     same safety bail-out behaviour as octstr_insert().

2007-04-11 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
   * gw/sms.c: fixed #397 that smsbox blocked HTTP requests.

2007-04-04  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
   * configure[.in]: modified the docbook.dsl search path to be more generic
     since some distros have more recent version paths (ie. 1.79 for FC5 on 
     x86_86 architectures), and we don't want to sum up every single version.
     We relly on any match we get in the for shell loop and continue.

(CB) * gwlib/cfg.def, gw/bb_boxc.c: re-defining logic for the 'smsbox-route' group
     that is used for MO routing to different (identified) smsbox connections.
     We know support the splitting of shortcodes depending on various source
     smsc-ids to various smsbox connections. So this behaviour is more generic
     then the one before. The naming convention changed, this needs to be noted
     in the NEWS file for upcoming relase.

   * gwlib/cfg.[ch]: fix memleak and revert Alex's commit on destroying the 
     hook lists in cfg_destroy(). We need to do this in a global module scope,
     so we introduce cfg_[init|shudown]().
   * gwlib/gwlib.c: call cfg_init() and cfg_shutdown() while gwlib usage.
     Thanks to Florian Bruch for pointing to this inconsistancy.

2007-01-22  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
   * gwlib/gwmem-native.c: segfault prevention by setting all free()ed 
     pointers to NULL. This follows the secure coding principles of CERT-CC.
     A non NULLed pointer may be containing bogus after free() and a redo
     of gw_free() and hence free() will lead to segfault eventually.
     
2007-01-22  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
   * gwlib/dbpool_sqlite.c: remove gw_free() in sqlite_close_conn(), since
     sqlite's sqlite_close() will give a bogus pointer and we segfault.
   * gwlib/dbpool_sqlite3.c: same as above, also fix a deadlock while closing
     connection due to typo in while break condition.

    * gw/urltran.c: fxing alias support for sms-service in smsbox. Thanks to
      Vincent for analysis and patch. Also removed debugging grp_dump() from
      Alex' previous UTF-8 patch.

    * configure[.in], gwlib/regex.h: ensure that we use the pcreposix wrapper 
      lib for POSIX.1 instead of system regex if PCRE is enabled.

(CB)  * gw/sms.c, gw/smsbox.c, gw/urltrans.c, gw/smsc/smsc_at.c, gw/smsc/smsc_cimd2.c,
      gw/smsc/smsc_emi.c, gw/smsc/smsc_ois.c, gw/smsc/smsc_oisd.c, gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c,
      gw/smsc/smsc_soap.c, gwlib/charset.c, gwlib/charset.h, gwlib/latin1_to_gsm.h:
      Applied patch that converts internal kannel charset to UTF-8. Please note that
      I didn't add smsbox compatibility code, means smsbox expect text body to be 
      encoded in UTF-8 as default also MOs will be forwarded in UTF-8. It could be
      workarounded with charset cgi variable.

    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: fix once again URL in example of 'generic'
      in order not to use '&' char.

    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: fix URL in example of 'generic'
      system-type of smsc http group. Obviously brakets indicate an
      XML tag and jade doesn't like this.

    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: fix typo delete in XML structure.
    
2006-10-01  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: updating SMSC HTTP section for new
      'generic' system-type regex directives and a group example.
    * gwlib/cfg.def: adding 'status-[success|tempfail|permfail]-regex'
      to smsc group for 'generic' system-type of SMSC HTTP.
    * gw/urltranc.[ch]: adding urltrans_fill_escape_codes() to make the
      msg struct internal values available via the escape code function.
    * gw/smsc/smsc_http.c: adding the new 'generic' system-type to allow
      the usage of the escape code sequenced in send-url and regex parsing
      of HTTP response. This new system-type may handle a lot of existing
      properitary HTTP APIs of SMS gateway aggregators without the need to
      code and add the explicite HTTP API to this module.

    * test/test_urltrans.c: modified argument list for urltrans_find(), 
      according to previous patchset commit.

    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: section on new 'accepted-account' and
      'accepted-account-regex' config directives for sms-service group.
	* gwlib/cfg.def: adding 'accepted-account' and 'accepted-account-regex' 
	  config directives for sms-service group.
    * gw/smsbox.c, gw/urltrans.[ch]: adding service routing based on account
      field. This allows routing of MO messages depending on the account set
      by an aggregative SMSC provider.

    * gw/smsc/smsc_fake.c: add TODO comment to add a SMPP DLR payload text
      for a DLR returned back via fake module.
    * gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c: obey charset more closely in msg_to_pdu(), where
      we don't call charset_latin1_to_gsm() if charset flag of msg struct
      carries the "GSM-03.38" indication. This is not yet used by smsbox, but
      may be used by external modules before we have a clean transition to
      UTF-8 as internal charset and target charset indication via msg struct's
      charset value. Also ensures now that we write a "FAILED DLR SMS" 
      access-log entry if we receive a DLR, but can't find it via handle_dlr().
    
2006-09-29  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/http.h: remove semicolon ';' from #define of http_receive_result(),
      otherwise the macro is not usable in regular expressions in the code.
      Thanks to Paul for pointing this out.
