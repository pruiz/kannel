    * gw/bb_smscconn.c, gw/smscconn.c, gw/smscconn_p.h: apllied patch that implements
      speed/throughput meters on a per-smsc basis.
      Thanks to Alejandro Guerrieri <aguerrieri at kannel.org> for this patch.

2011-03-30 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * applied patch that fixes some issues for HTTP-SMSC:
      1) added support for max-pending-submits , so that we don't eat all our
         file descriptors if we have much traffic
      2) changed open_sends from long to Counter, avoid race conditions
      3) start new sender_thread because otherwise we are unable to limit max pending
         submits and if throughput is set we block the whole bearerbox instead of only
         one SMSC
      4) changed shutdown sequence to run safe in parallel

    * applied patch that fixes DDos issue with our HTTP-Server implementation
      (consume all available file descriptors) and also adds possibility to
      set keep alive timeout for each listen port.

This patch will limit maximum open client connections to 500. 

2011-03-25  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/dbpool_sqlite3.c: ensure we handle the sqlite3 version >= 3.3.9
      function call switching via #if pre-processor macro so we choose either
      sqlite3_prepare_v2() if we do have a local sqlite3 version that supports
      it. This ensures we build again on CentOS 5.x ie.

    * gwlib/log.c: Comparing a va_list with NULL is bogus. It's supposed to be treated like
      an opaque type and only be manipulated with va_* accessors. This fixes #587.

2011-03-12  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_http.c: reverting back last commit due to veto if Alex. Need

      we get DC_UCS2 coding in the payload.

    * applied patch that adds sqlite3 DB and DLR support. This patch was originally
      contributed by David Butler, posted 2009-11-23 to the list, with Msg-ID
      <22DE7AAC95BA4B5A9EEF3FEC90222162@VAIO>. Stipe added userguide parts and
      fixed destination number prefix handling.

2011-03-08 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/list.c: applied patch which fixes a rare memory leak.
      When the destroy is called, it extracts until a NULL is found, which may
      not necessarily be the last item in the list as gwlist allows you to add
      NULL items to it.
      Thanks to Donald Jackson <djackson at kannel.org> for this patch.

      facility to use.
