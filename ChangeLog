Sat Apr 22 23:35:27 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/http2.[ch]: Implemented GET CGI argument parsing.

Sat Apr 22 22:55:05 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/http2.[ch]: Moved PoolSocket's out of .c into .h and
	renamed them to HTTPSocket. This is because the server also
	needs to use them to keep implementation work easy. Thus, the
	server is represented as an HTTPSocket, not an int. Re-arranged
	some of the internal functions in .c regarding this.
	
	Oh yes, I implemented a bit of the server side part of the
	protocol as well. Need to do CGI argument parsing still.
	
	* test/test_http2_server.c: Wrote test program for server side.

Sat Apr 22 21:07:11 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/gwmem.[ch]: Now report the name of the calling function
	as well as the file and source line (this requires a compiler
	that supports __FUNCTION__). Also, added gw_assert_allocated
	for checking that a pointer points at an allocated area.
	
	* gwlib/octstr.c, test/test_mem.c: Made use of gwlib/octstr.c.
	
Sat Apr 22 19:28:52 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/gwmem.c: Turned memory checks back on by default.
	
	* gwlib/http2.c: If reading the status fails, close the connection
	and open a new one. If that also fails, *then* report to caller.
	It seems sometimes at least Apache manages to close the connection
	(even though it hasn't been idle for several milliseconds) *after*
	we have sent the request. This masks such a temporary error from
	the library user.
	
	Also, bug fix: We look for an *unused* PoolSocket instead of a
	used when, when allocating.
	
	* test/test_http2.c: Made it possible to run many threads do many
	client operations.

Sat Apr 22 02:57:22 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* test/run-http2-tests, test/test_http.c: Added -s option to
	old HTTP tester as well, and made test/run-http2-tests compare
	the results of the old and new ones as well as lynx.

Sat Apr 22 02:40:38 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	*  gwlib/http2.[ch]: Wrote. This is the beginning of the new
	HTTP implementation.

	* test/http2-test-urls, test/run-http2-tests, test/test_http2.c:
	Testing harness for the new HTTP implementation.

	* gwlib/octstr.h: Fixed comment explaining error return.

2000-04-20  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* Made read_to_eof set its output parameter to NULL on error,
	instead of leaving garbage in it.  This fixes PR#52 reported
	by Paul Keogh.

2000-04-20  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* doc/arch/.cvsignore, doc/userguide/.cvsignore: New files.

	* gw/smsc_smpp.c, gw/smsc_smpp.h: Got rid of all uses of uint32_t.
	* gwlib/octstr.c: Got rid of all uses of uint32_t.

	* gwlib/utils.c, gwlib/utils.h: Provided encode_network_long and
	decode_network_long to help the functions that (erroneously) used
	uint32_t as an "exactly 4 octets" type.

	* gwlib/gwstdint.h: Removed.  No code refers to uint32_t (or any
	of its cousins) anymore.  This fixes PR#50, reported by David Reid.

	* config.h.in, configure.in, README.autoconf: Removed tests
	for uint32_t and stdint.h.  Re-ran autoconf.

2000-04-20  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/octstr.h, gwlib/octstr.c: Removed octstr_cat_char,
	all callers to it really wanted octstr_append_char and have
	been changed.

2000-04-19  Tuomas Luttinen  <tuo@wapit.com>

	* gw/wml_compiler.c: Now uses the struct to carry WML binary, the
	headers and string table.

2000-04-18  Tuomas Luttinen  <tuo@wapit.com>

	* gw/wml_compiler.c: type conflict with output_char corrected, 
	calls to octstr_cat_char removed.

2000-04-18  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/octstr.c, gwlib/octstr.h: Added octstr_append_from_socket.
	Corrected EINTR handling in octstr_write_to_socket.

	* gwlib/socket.c: Made read_available() cope with EINTR.

2000-04-18 Sanna Seppanan <sanna@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/list.h,c Added list_cat. It joins two lists to one.

Mon Apr 17 20:25:19 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* test/test_list.c: Fixed more pthread_t vs long warnings.

2000-04-17 Sanna Seppanen <sanna@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/octstr.h,c: Added octstr_get_digit_from(). Searches long int 
	from octstr.

Sat Apr 15 19:45:50 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* utils/daily-patch: Skip changes to gateway/configure.

Sat Apr 15 19:19:08 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/log.[ch]: Added function close_all_logfiles based on
	patch from Paul Keogh.

Sat Apr 15 18:31:55 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/thread.c: mutex_lock now checks that it doesn't lock the
	mutex twice and panics if it does.

Sat Apr 15 18:01:39 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/smsc_emi.c: If B115200 is not defined, use B38400 instead.
	This compiles, but I can't test it right now.

Sat Apr 15 17:40:18 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* test/test_list.c: More fixes to correct assumptions that
	pthread_t == long.

Sat Apr 15 17:30:51 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* config.h.in, configure.in: Fixed --enable-docs option and added
	(under protest but under pressure) a --enable-localtime option
	for outputting time stamps in configuration files as local time
	instead of GMT.

2000-04-14  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/thread.c: Got rid of some #ifdefs by assuming HAVE_PTHREAD_H.

	* test/list.c: Fixed one more pthread_t == long assumption.

Thu Apr 13 21:01:20 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/thread.h: Removed obsolete definitions for pthread_t etc
	on systems without <pthread.h>.
	
	* test/test_list.c: Fixed so it won't assume pthread_t is a long
	or compatible with a long.

Thu Apr 13 18:35:15 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* Making release 0.7.1.

Thu Apr 13 17:14:40 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/bearerbox.c: Commented out extraneous debugging message.
	
	* gw/wsp.c: Function transaction_belongs_to_session: Check that
	neither machine is unused.
	
	* test/fakesmsc.c: Always try reading at least once, even if
	timeout has already occured. This helps in high-load situations.
	
	* test/fakewap.c: Print "finished session" messages even if
	interval is very small.

2000-04-13  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gw/smsc_cimd.c: Fixed message text loading for messages with both
	UDH and normal text.

2000-04-13    <Kalle Marjola <rpr@wapit.com>>

	* gw/bearerbox.c: tried to fix saturation problem; failed but now
	works a bit better. Also added max-queue variable reading, it had
	been lost in some point. I will try to fix saturation later on

	* gw/smsbox.c: removed that thread-safe heartbeat thingy, it is of
	no use (sorry Liw :)

Wed Apr 12  2000  Derry Hamilton  <rasilon@tardis.ed.ac.uk

        * utils/start-stop-daemon.c: Implemented pid_is_user and pid_is_cmd
	for solaris.


2000-04-12  Tuomas Luttinen  <tuo@tuo.wapit.fi>

	* gwlib/octstr.[ch]: Function octstr_append_char added.

	* gw/wml_compiler.c: Attribute values are now searched for text
	that can be replaced with one byte value codes.

Wed Apr 12 00:30:54 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* test/fakewap.c, test/test_http.c, test/test_urltrans.c,
	utils/start-stop-daemon.c: Changed references to <getopt.h>
	to <unistd.h>, except in start-stop-daemon, where <getopt.h>
	is still needed because of getopt_long.
	
	Thanks to kean.leong.ang@my.arthurandersen.com for noticing
	this (and providing a patch, even though I did it slightly
	differently).

Tue Apr 11 21:57:17 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/bearerbox.c: Try harder to read from smsbox to avoid the
	problem of not noticing smsbox heartbeats when incoming traffic
	is too fast.
	
	* gw/smsbox.c: Panic if bearerbox connection fails. 
	
	* test/fakesmsc.c: Rewritten so as not to busy loop.

2000-04-11  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/socket.c, gwlib/socket.h: Added socket_query_blocking
	and socket_set_blocking functions.  Untested.

2000-04-11  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/thread.c: Made mutex_destroy silently handle a NULL mutex,
	like other destroy functions.

	* gw/smsc.c: In smscenter_destruct(), also destroy smsc->mutex,
	to fix memory leak.  (Thanks to Paul Keogh)

2000-04-10  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/octstr.c: Corrected off-by-one errors in octstr_convert_range
	and octstr_check_range.

2000-04-10  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/octstr.c: In octstr_search_char_from, don't assert that
	pos <= ostr->len.  Just return -1 in that case.  This preserves
	the old behaviour, and makes the function easier to use.

2000-04-10  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gw/wsp_http.c: Made convert_to_self call octstr_duplicate rather
	than returning its argument directly.  Its caller expects to be
	able to free the argument.

2000-04-10  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/octstr.c, gwlib/octstr.h: Reimplemented octstr_search_str
	as octstr_search_cstr, removing the old one.  Added octstr_search
	(for two Octstrs).  Reimplemented octstr_search_char_from to use
	memchr instead of the octstr_get_char interface, for speed.

2000-04-10 Sanna Seppanen <sanna@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/octstr.c,h: octstr_search_str()-function memory-leak fixed.
	If it is still somehow suspicious, please fix it! I do use it in my
	implementations.
	
Sun Apr  9 20:42:08 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* Makefile.in: Added nag target.
	
	* utils/find-long-lines: Wrote.
	
	* test/test_udp.c, test/test_list.c, test/fakewap.c, test/fakesmsc.c:
	Re-formatted some long lines.
	
	* gw/wsp.[ch], gw/wsp_machine-decl.h: Wrote function
	wsp_machine_mark_unused. This marks a WSPMachine as unused.
	
	* gw/wsp.c: wsp_machine_destroy now removes the machine from
	the list of WSPMachines. wsp_shutdown and same_client changed
	correspondingly.  wsp_handle_event calls wsp_machine_destroy if
	it notices the machine becomes unused.
	
	* gw/wsp_state-decl.h: Changed to use wsp_machine_mark_unused instead
	of mucking around with the client_port field.
	
	* gw/wtp.c: wtp_handle_event removes machine if it notices it
	is unused.

Sun Apr  9 02:18:38 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* More memory leak fixes, now in bearerbox. Now it should be possible
	to run heavy and long time stress tests on all three boxes.

	* gw/bb_msg.[ch]: Wrote function rq_destroy.

	* gw/bearerbox.c: Wrote function destroy_bb. Added functions for
	freeing memory at end of main.

	* gw/wdp_udp.c: Octstr with client address now freed.

	* Some other changes as well.

	* gw/wtp.c: Bugfix. timer field of WTPMachine set to NULL after
	having been destroyed, so that wtp_machine_destroy doesn't try to
	destroy it a second time.

	* gw/wtp_timer.c: wtp_timer_destroy is now safe to call with NULL.
	(All our other _destroy functions are, so this one should also be.)

	* gwlib/gwmem.c: forget() does not fill the area any more, because
	this causes problems with realloc. This is a workaround, and needs
	to be handled better when I'm awake.

Sun Apr  9 00:33:59 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* Memory leak fixes.

	* gw/wapbox.c: Destroy received messages after they have been
	processed. Also destroy event created from the incoming message
	if no WTP machine for processing it can be found.

	* gw/wsp.c: Destroy handled events in wsp_handle_event. Destroy
	temporary Octstrs for holding the binary data of capabilities and
	headers.

	* gw/wsp_http.c: One more place where the content type returned by
	http_get_u wasn't destroyed. Also, the event wsp_http_thread gets
	as an argument is destroyed properly, and (bugfix!) not used after
	being destroyed.

	* gw/wsp_state-decl.h: Correctly duplicate data for event to be
	sent to wsp_http_thread.

	* gw/wtp_tid.c: Removed comments from around cache_item_destroy
	and used it to destroy the tid cache at shutdown.

	* gw/wtp_timer.c: wtp_timer_destroy and wtp_timer_stop now destroy
	the event associated with the timer.

	* Also made some other changes:

	* gw/wtp_send.c: Removed unnecessary error checkings for packing
	functions.

	* gw/wtp_timer.c: Made the global variable `timers' into a static.

	* gwlib/http.[ch]: Wrote header_duplicate.

	* gwlib/octstr.c: octstr_duplicate now returns NULL for a NULL
	argument, instead of crashing.

Sat Apr  8 22:31:45 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/smsbox.c: Added informational message that smsbox is
	terminating.

	* gw/wapbox.c: Added more destruction and freeing things to end of
	main. This helps debugging memory leaks.

	* gw/wtp.h, gw/wtp_tid.h, gw/wtp_timer.h, gw/wtp_timer.c: Added
	shutdown functions.

	* test/wml_tester.c: Added call to gw_check_leaks to help debug
	memory leaks (none found in WML compiler, however).

	* gw/wsp.h, gw/wsp.c: Removed `next' element of WSPEvent structure,
	since it was unused. Also added a wsp_event_duplicate function.

	* gw/wsp.c: Really implemented wsp_machine_destroy. It's now used
	by the wsp_shutdown function, the client_port element is still set
	to -1 to signal an unused WSPMachine.

	* gw/wsp_http.c: Memory leak fixes. The type string returned by
	http_get_u is now freed, as is the data it returns and the Octstr
	copy made of it.

	* gw/wtp.c: Memory leak fixes. Implemented wtp_machine_destroy as
	a static function. Changed initializations of OCTSTR and WSP_EVENT
	type fields in WTPMachine so that empty things aren't allocated
	unnecessarily (and then leaked by overwriting the pointer without
	freeing the always unused empty things allocated).

	* gw/wtp_send.c: Possible memory leak fixes (though not necessarily
	actual, but that might be a problem in my testing): destroy Octstrs
	before overwriting the pointer with a new one.

	* gw/wtp_state-decl.h: Memory leak fixes: freeing things before
	overwriting the pointer to them. In some cases not allocating
	a thing that isn't going to be used at all.

	* gwlib/http.c: Memory leak fixes.

	* gwlib/octstr.[ch]: Commented out octstr_search_str since it isn't
	being used and seems suspicious. Also fixed seems_valid_real to
	report the name of the function as the name of the function instead
	of reporting the name of the file as the name of the function.

2000-04-08  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/gwassert.h: Updated NDEBUG version of gw_asswert_place
	to match normal version.

2000-04-08  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gw/wtp_timer.c: Removed debugging output again for normal
	operations.

2000-04-08  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/octstr.c: More assertions.

2000-04-08  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gw/wtp_timer.c: Converted to use generic List code.  This should
	fix a number of bugs in the timer code.  Also changed to a single
	indentation style, and made all log messages full sentences.
	Restored some debugging output about timers because I'm debugging
	them.

	* gw/wtp.c: In pack_wsp_event, call octstr_duplicate on
	exit_info instead of sharing it between the WSP and WTP
	events.  (The WTP event will be destroyed soon afterwards,
	taking its octstrs with it).

	* gw/wtp_tid.c: In cache_item_create_empty, initialize item->next
	too.  Also initialize source_address and destination_address to
	NULL instead of to empty octstrs (prevents memory leak).
	In tid_cached, use a temporary variable when returning the tid,
	to avoid accessing a cache element after releasing the lock.

Sat Apr  8 01:01:00 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/smsbox.c, gw/urltrans.c, gw/wapbox.c, gw/wsp.c, gw/wsp.h,
	gwlib/log.c, Fixed some memory leaks. smsbox now report no
	allocated areas after serving 1000 "nop" services.

Fri Apr  7 19:20:41 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/bearerbox.c, gw/boxc.c, gw/smsbox.c, gw/smsbox_req.c,
	gw/wapbox.c, gw/wsp.c, gw/wsp_http.c, gw/wsp_state-decl.h,
	gw/wtp.c, gw/wtp_send.c, gw/wtp_state-decl.h, gw/wtp_tid.c,
	gw/wtp_timer.c, gwlib/http.c: Removed hopefully unnecessary
	debugging output to make it possible to run things in heavy
	production use.

Fri Apr  7 17:25:39 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/gwmem.c: gw_free: Removed #if 0 around call to real free.
	
	* test/fakewap.c: Bugfix. Length of UDP packet was computed 
	incorrectly, causing wapbox to get rather confused. (That's
	also a bug, but will be fixed later.)

2000-04-07 Aarno Syvänen <syvanen@wapit.com>

	* wtp.c, wtp_state-decl.h: Included wtp_timer_destroy call in function
	machine_mark_unused, so that a timer created is allways destroyed when
	a transaction ends.

Fri Apr  7 15:08:50 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/gwassert.h: Made gw_assert_place also report the actual
	place its called from.
	
	* gwlib/octstr.c: Made seems_valid_real report the calling
	function name also, and re-wrote the assertions so that it is
	easier to see which condition failed. Added some assertions
	as well.

2000-04-06  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/octstr.c, gwlib/octstr.h: Added new functions
	octstr_binary_to_hex, octstr_hex_to_binary,
	octstr_parse_long, octstr_check_range, and octstr_convert_range.
	They compile fine and have been tested a little, but none
	of them have been used in real code yet -- use with care.

Thu Apr  6 17:52:16 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wsp_http.c: Add X_Network_Info and X-WAP-Session-ID headers.

2000-04-05 Aarno Syvänen <syvanen@wapit.com>

	* wsp*, wtp*: Changed primitive event names to conform even more 
	closely names used by the specifications.

Wed Apr  5 18:38:20 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* README.docbook: Added note about transfig being needed.

Wed Apr  5 18:20:52 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* csdr.[ch] renamed to wdp_udp.[ch] and other files modified
	accordingly.

2000-04-05  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* wmlscript/wsint.h: Restored "extern int yylex()" declaration.
	That at least shuts up -Wall, and there is no clean solution because
	we have to deal with Bison output.

2000-04-04 Aarno Syvänen <syvanen@wapit.com>

	* wtp_send.c|h: Changed tid type to int

	* wapbox.c|h: Select connectionless requests out before calling wtp.
	They made mess of wtp error handling mechanism.

Tue Apr  4 17:55:10 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* utils/kannel-log-summary: Wrote. Requires AWK. Improvements
	welcome.

Tue Apr  4 14:57:55 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/urltrans.c: Changed to use List.

Tue Apr  4 14:42:54 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/urltrans.c, gw/wsp_headers.c, gw/wsp_headers.h,
	gwlib/octstr.c, gwlib/octstr.h: Removed OctstrList, use plain
	List instead.

Tue Apr  4 14:15:27 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/bb_msg.c, gw/bearerbox.c, gw/boxc.c, gw/msg.c, gw/smsbox.c,
	gw/smsbox_req.c, gw/wapbox.c, gw/wsp.c, gw/wsp_http.c, gw/wtp.c,
	gw/wtp_send.c, gw/wtp_send.h, gw/wtp_timer.c, gwlib/http.c:
	Changed calls to assert to calls to gw_assert.

Mon Apr  3 21:58:19 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/smsbox.c: Fixed a memory leak in error conditions. Also
	rewrote send_heartbeat so it doesn't use a static variable.
	
	* gwlib/gwmem.c: Make filling allocated and freed memory areas
	optionsl. There is a bug somewhere that causes filling of freed
	memory areas to crash.

Mon Apr  3 21:02:49 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* test/test_urltrans.c: Wrote. Useful for testing memory leaks.
	
	* gw/msg.[ch]: Used long instead of int32.
	
	* gw/smsbox.c: Fixed output restriction format in debugging statement.
	Also added a call to gw_check_leaks so that memory leaks can be
	reported.
	
	* gw/urltrans.c: urltrans_destroy now works even when called
	a NULL argument. Also, fixed a couple of memory leaks:
	urltrans_destroy frees the actual list header node as
	well, urltrans_find frees the temporary list of words, and
	destroy_onetrans frees the username and password fields. (The work
	on gwmem.c starts paying.)
	
	* gwlib/gwassert.h: Added a gw_assert_place macro so that the
	caller can set explicitly the place reported.
	
	* gwlib/gwmem.[ch]: Record location where memory allocation is made,
	so that gw_check_leak can report it.
	
	* gwlib/octstr.c: seems_valid reports the place it is called from
	in the assertion error messages, not the places where gw_assert
	fails.
	
	* test/test_http.c: Added -r option for repeating the fetch.
	
Mon Apr  3 18:55:46 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/socket.c: Changed certain AF_INET constants back to
	PF_INET. I'm stupid.
	
	* test/fakewap.c: Added 'c:' to getopt arguments and made -h work.
	Thanks to Adam Kelly.
	
	* gwlib/list.c: list_destroy destroys the condition variable for
	the list as well. Thanks to Paul Keogh.

Mon Apr  3 18:52:48 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/gwassert.h: Remove unnecessary and disfunctional #ifndef
	wrapper.

2000-04-03  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/octstr.c: Made octstr_write_to_socket() retry after EINTR.

2000-04-03  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/gwstr.c, gwlib/gwstr.h: Removed split_words(), it has been
	superseded by octstr_split_words().

	* gwlib/gwstr.c, gwlib/gwstr.h: Removed url_decode(), it has been
	superseded by octstr_url_decode().

	* gw/urltrans.h: Removed bogus paragraph from the function
	comment for urltrans_get_pattern.

2000-04-03  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* wmlscript/wsint.h: Always define WsInt32 to long and WsUInt32
	to unsigned long, rather than looking for a type of exactly four
	bytes.

	* wmlscript/wslexer.c: Pass ws_stream_getc a pointer to 'WsUInt32',
	like it asks, rather than 'unsigned int', which might be smaller.

	* wmlscript/wmlsdasm.c: Print a v_int constant as a long, rather
	than int.

	* config.h.in, configure.in, configure: Completely got rid of
	SIZEOF_INT and SIZEOF_LONG constants.

2000-03-31 Aarno Syvänen <syvanen@wapit.com>

	* wtp.c: Tell_about_error: remove debuggung statements causing 
	segfaults. In addition, locks to serialise reassemby.

2000-03-31  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/octstr.c: Made octstr_decode_url not segfault on empty
	octstrs.  Added assertions.

Fri Mar 31 04:58:20 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/gwmem.c: Formatting and other minor changes.

Fri Mar 31 03:35:59 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/csdr.[ch]: Changed to use Octstrs and udp_* functions
	from gwlib.
	
	* gwlib/socket.c: Changed udp_create_address so that it accepts
	"*" as a hostname alias for INADDR_ANY.

Fri Mar 31 02:17:52 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/socket.c: Changed PF_INET to AF_INET.
	
	* test/fakewap.c: Made command line parsing much more user friendly.
	Also started cleaning up the implementation, so that it, for
	example, uses gwlib and avoids using quite as many magic numbers
	and convoluted logic, but got bored and decided to do something
	else instead. Current version works, however. Removed some unwanted
	Windows stuff (the goal is to make gwlib work in Windows and make
	fakewap use that).
	
	Removed unnecessary option to set sender port number.

Fri Mar 31 00:31:21 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* debian/*: Added Debian packaging files. The Debian package is not
	yet official, but these files allow one to build a Debian package.
	
	* Makefile.in, configure.in: Check whether start-stop-daemon
	already exists and use the system one if it does (it only exists
	on Debian, though).
	
	* utils/kannel-init.d: Changed location of box programs and 
	configuration files.

2000-03-30  Tuomas Luttinen  <tuo@wapit.com>

	* gw/wml_compiler.c: Memory leaks stiched.

	* gwlib/octstr.[ch]: octstr_str_compare added.

2000-03-30    <Kalle Marjola <rpr@wapit.com>>

	* gw/cgi.*: changed argument list value into Octstr to allow
	UDH-fields to have %00 on them

	* gw/bearerbox.c, gw/smsbox*.c: fixed cgiarg uses

	* gwlib/octstr.c|h: added function octstr_url_decode (copied from
	gwstr)

2000-03-30  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/socket.c: Cast sockaddr arguments for recvfrom() and
	sendto() to (struct sockaddr *).

2000-03-30  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/socket.c: Tidied up gethostnameinfo(), removed excessive
	use of __ in names.

2000-03-30    <Kalle Marjola <rpr@wapit.com>>

	* gwlib/octstr.c: removed wrong assertion from octstr_truncate

Thu Mar 30 06:51:03 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/octstr.[ch]: Changed octstr_create_from_data and
	octstr_get_many_chars to get void* instead of char*.
	
	* gwlib/socket.[ch]: Wrote some generic UDP socket handling things.

Thu Mar 30 05:28:02 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* acconfig.h, config.h.bot, config.h.top, stamp-h.in: Removed as
	unnecessary.
	
	* config.h.in, configure.in, gwlib/conffile.h, gwlib/log.c:
	Cleaned up by removing unnecessary checks. For example, since
	we *require* an ANSI C compiler anyway, there's no point in
	checking for const.

Thu Mar 30 04:47:25 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/gwmem.c: Added some code to keep track of memory allocations
	and to check that frees free freeable memory.
	
	* lotsafiles: Added a gw_init_mem call to the beginning of each
	(relevant) main function.

Thu Mar 30 03:10:21 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wsp.c: Made use of Counters.

Thu Mar 30 03:05:53 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/counter.[ch]: Wrote.
	
	* test/test_counter.c: Wrote.

Thu Mar 30 02:25:51 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* lotsafiles: Made minor tweaks to make things compile on my
	machine with CFLAGS='-Wall -O2 -g -Wbad-function-cast -Wcast-align
	-Wsign-compare -Wstrict-prototypes -Wmissing-prototypes
	-Wmissing-declarations' (which is getting pretty aggressive).

Thu Mar 30 01:27:40 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* Changed msg_dump and octstr_dump to take a "level" argument.
	This allows them to indent dumps within dumps correctly. Related
	changes at callers.

Thu Mar 30 01:04:34 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wsp.c, gw/wsp.h, gw/wsp_machine-decl.h: Changed
	METHOD_MACHINE and SESSION_MACHINE macros so that their users
	provide all punctuation. This will more easily allow certain
	nifty stuff in the future.

Thu Mar 30 00:57:58 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* utils/attgetopt.c: Added AT&T's public domain implementation of
	getopt(3).
	
	* Makefile.in, config.h.in, configure.in,
	utils/start-stop-daemon.c:  Modified to check for and use getopt,
	getopt_long, and getopt_h, and to use attgetopt.c if no system
	getopt is found.

Thu Mar 30 00:24:52 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* daily-patch: Added a summary to beginning of report.

Thu Mar 30 00:01:35 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* Makefile.in: Removed -I options from CFLAGS. We're supposed to
	refer to header files in other ways than assuming -I. You need to
	re-run configure (or at least config.status).

	* lotsafiles: Changed header file references to include directory
	names where necessary.

Wed Mar 29 23:42:40 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/gwmem.c: Added some asserts. Also, gw_malloc now fills the
	memory area with 0xbabecafe so as to make sure it is _NOT_ all bits
	zero.

Wed Mar 29 23:29:26 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/octstr.[ch]: Added gw_asserts and cleaned up formatting.

Wed Mar 29 23:01:15 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/list.c: Changed assert to gw_assert.
	
	* test/test_list.c: Cleanups.

Wed Mar 29 21:59:53 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* Makefile.in: Removed installation of test_wml, since it's obsolete.
	
	* configure.in, config.h.in: Check specifically for 1.8.6 of libxml.
	
	* gw/wml_compiler.c: Use kludge around 1.8.6 bugfix conditionally.

2000-03-29  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/gwassert.h: New file, defines gw_assert() macro which
	calls panic() when an assertion fails, instead of writing to
	stdout.  stdout is not available when kannel runs as a daemon.

	* Makefile.in: Put libgwlib.a after libwmlscript.a in the
	libs line, because libwmlscript.a now needs the panic symbol
	from libgwlib.a.

	* gwlib/gwlib.h: Include gwassert.h by default.

	* gwlib/gwmem.c, gwlib/octstr.c, wmlscript/*: Use gw_assert()
	instead of assert().

Wed Mar 29 20:44:52 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/msg.c: Cleanups. No need to check that msg_create returns
	non-NULL (it panics, if it fails). Use octstr_duplicate instead
	of doing it manually with octstr_copy.
	
	* gw/wtp_send.c: Bugfix. wtp_send_result used to return the same
	message copy that it passed on to put_msg_in_queue. The caller
	would then make a duplicate. This is a race condition: sometimes
	the message in the queue would be processed and destroyed before
	the caller had time to duplicate the message. Changed it so that
	wtp_send_result makes the duplicate itself, since that is the
	only reasonable way to avoid the race condition.
	
	* gw/wtp_state-decl.h: Changed to use result from wtp_send_result
	directly, instead of duplicating it.

Wed Mar 29 19:44:05 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* test/test_list.c: Fixed warnings.

2000-03-29  Aarno Syvänen <syvanen@wapit.com>

	* wtp.c: Added locks for serialising reassembly

2000-03-29    <Kalle Marjola <rpr@wapit.com>>

	* gw/*box*.c: fixed some udh-things like it is now possible to
	send UDH without text field

	* gw/smsc_cimd.c: fixed that it discarded message without text
	file, but with udh field

2000-03-29  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/octstr.c: Added static octstr_grow() call for other
	octstr methods to use.  This gets rid of some duplicate code.

Tue Mar 28 21:16:35 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* doc/CodingStyle: Added various stuff.

2000-03-29 Sanna Seppanen <sanna@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/http.c: restored the old file to fix the GET
	functionality

2000-03-29  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/octstr.c: Small changes to deal with the possibility
	of ostr->data being NULL if ostr->size is 0.

2000-03-29  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/gwmem.c: Add assertion (size > 0) to gw_malloc.

2000-03-29    <Kalle Marjola <rpr@wapit.com>>

	* gw/smsbox_req.c: some simple truncation to UDH sending (not
	sufficient but should help a bit) and little flag fix

	* gw/smsc_sema.c: fix of 120 char problem by Hao Shi

2000-03-29  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gw/smsc_smpp.h: Removed definitions of unused empty structures
	smpp_pdu_unbind, smpp_pdu_unbind_resp, smpp_pdu_enquire_link, and
	smpp_pdu_enquire_link_resp.

2000-03-29 Sanna Seppanen <sanna@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/http.c: http_get_u() deleted a bunch of duplicate code.
	GET query is sent as a message body.

2000-03-28 Aarno Syvänen <syvanen@wapit.com>

	* wtp*,  wsp*: Changed primitive names. Now they conform with ones 
	used by the specifications. 

Tue Mar 28 16:14:49 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/list.[ch]: added functions list_delete_all, list_delete_equal,
	and list_extract_all. Also added a typedef for the comparision
	function type used by several list functions.
	
	* test/test_list.c: Wrote additional test for the new functions.

2000-03-28 Aarno Syvänen <syvanen@wapit.com>

	* wtp_state-decl.h: Allocated memory for resended messages

	* wapbox.c: Deallocate memory reserved for messages. (Based on tips 
	from Paul Keogh) In addition, added timer mutex iniatilisation.

	* wtp.c: Added locks for machines. Added structure segments for making
	reassembly thread safe. 

2000-03-28  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* utils/start-stop-daemon.c: Put conditional OSLinux || OSHURD
	around the definitions for pid_is_user and pid_is_cmd, because
	those functions are not defined for OSSunos.  This is probably
	not the last of the changes needed; we'll see.

2000-03-28    <Kalle Marjola <rpr@wapit.com>>

	* gw/smsbox_req.c: added UDH sending code alpha test. Use field
	'udh' in sendsms http interface

	* gw/smsbox.c: fixed one mutex problem which only occured if there
	was some problems

	* gw/msg.h: marked that most functions do not fail, but panic

	* gw/msg-decl.h: removed plain_sms, which was not used anymore

2000-03-27 Aarno Syvänen <syvanen@wapit.com>

	* wtp*: Added some comments. Made code review changes. Added code for
	timers (This is,  how ever, still commented out. It must be tested with
	a new version of fakewap.). Corrected some of memory leaks pointed out
	by Paul Keogh.

	* wtp.c: Added lock for the global wtp transaction identifier.

2000-03-27    <Kalle Marjola <rpr@wapit.com>>

	* gw/bearerbox.c: changed 'http-port' into 'http-admin-port', to
	lessen confusion. Old name still works, too.

	* gw/bb.h: modified default http-admin-port to 13000 and
	wapbox-port to 13002 to keep ports close to each other

	* */*.conf: changed that name and port in configuration files

	* doc/userguide/userguide.xml: renamed variables updated in
	userguide.
	
	* gw/smsc_cimd_c: commented out that the connection dies if the
	expected string is not received, as this caused problems with
	slower link

	* gwlib/utils.h: added -D option in output
	
2000-03-25 Derry Hamilton <rasilon@tardis.ed.ac.uk>
	* Makefile.in: Added -Iutils to CFLAGS
	* utils/start-stop-daemon.c: Added short option only stuff.
	  Cast pid_t to int so that printf gets it right
	* utils/kannel-nag: Now asks for bash specifically rather than assuming
	  that /bin/sh is actually bash
	* gw/smsc_sema.c: Replaced bzero with memset
	* gw/wml_compiler.c: Cast arguments to isalpha and isalnum to int 
	  (are char)
	* gwlib/http.c: similar, for isspace

Fri Mar 24 16:43:16 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* Making release 0.7.

Fri Mar 24 14:52:19 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/http.c: Changed it so that binary images also work.
	
	* test/test_http.c: Wrote.

2000-03-24 Sanna Seppänen <sanna@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/http.c: tested and debugged
	httprequest_replace_header().

Fri Mar 24 12:38:33 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* configure.in, configure: Check that gnome-xml is at least 1.8.6.

2000-03-24 Sanna Seppänen <sanna@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/http.c,h: header_destroy returns now a pointer to the
	next header. tested and debugged httprequest_remove_header().

Thu Mar 23 19:58:44 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/bb_msg.h, gw/bearerbox.c, gw/msg.c, gw/msg.h, gw/urltrans.h,
	gw/wsp.c, gw/wsp.h, gw/wtp.c, gw/wtp.h, gwlib/http.h: Removed
	commas from end of enum definitions. These would be very useful
	(since some of them are generated automatically), but they're
	against the C specification (and I distinctly remembered they
	were not).  Thanks to Markku Rossi for putting me straight.

Thu Mar 23 19:37:03 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wml_compiler.[ch]: Removed kludge to not use the new WML
	compiler when libxml is not installed while compiling. The new
	WML compiler is becoming required by this change - if you don't
	have libxml already, install it, or you lose.
	
	* gw/wsp_http.c: Don't use the old compiler at all.

Thu Mar 23 19:22:18 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* README: Changed requirement for libxml to at least 1.8.6,
	since 1.8.5 resulted in problems (last character of WML source
	was mangled).

2000-03-23  Tuomas Luttinen  <tuo@wapit.com>

	* gw/wml_compiler.c: The global variable for the binary removed, now
	should be thread safe.

	* test/wml_tester.c : Minor formatting changes.

2000-03-23 Sanna Seppanen <sanna@wapit.com>

	*gwlib/http.c: corrected error in httprequest_add_header. hope
	it'll work now.

Tue Mar 21 16:46:04 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* doc/CodingStyle: Modified the description of using panic.

2000-03-23    <Kalle Marjola <rpr@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/log.c|h: added negation to -D (debug place) command line
	option, which is used with starting '-'

	* gwlib/utils.h, doc/CodingStyle: commented -D option

2000-03-23 Sanna Seppanen <sanna@wapit.com>
	
	* gwlib/http.c, http.h: added comments.

2000-03-22  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gw/smsc_cimd.c: Removed some bogus errno values in error messages.

2000-03-22 Sanna Seppanen <sanna@wapit.com>
	
	* gwlib/http.c: htp_get_u: After furthed investigation,
	zero-valued "Content-Length" header is valid, changing back.

2000-03-22 Sanna Seppanen <sanna@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/http.c: A minor fix to header_pack(). Check the sprintf
	return value. header_create() return NULL if fails.
	* gwlib/http.c: htp_get_u: zero-valued "Content-Length" header 
	from phone won't be sent to web server.
	
2000-03-22 Derry Hamilton <rasilon@tardis.ed.ac.uk>

	* gwlib/http.h: Modified the definition of header_dump to
	match that in gwlib/http.c

2000-03-21 Sanna Seppanen <sanna@wapit.com>

        * gwlib/http.c: internal_base6t4() uses rint(). alpha doesn't
	recognize it, so implemented it as round_to_closest_integer().

2000-03-21 Sanna Seppanen <sanna@wapit.com>

        * gwlib/http.c: Rewrote httprequest_get_header_value().

2000-03-21 Sanna Seppanen <sanna@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/http.c: Rewrote httprequest_remove_header().

2000-03-21 Sanna Seppanen <sanna@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/http.c: Rewrote httprequest_replace_header().

2000-03-21 Sanna Seppanen <sanna@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/http.c: Corrected some debug sentences. Harvest of code
	review: the return type of header_dump() changed to void. 
	rewrited httprequest_add_header(). 

2000-03-21  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gw/smsc_emi.c: small changes, in preparation for large changes.

2000-03-21 Sanna Seppanen <sanna@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/http.c: Changed socklen_t to int according to manual in
	httpserver_get_request.

2000-03-21  Tuomas Luttinen  <tuo@wapit.com>

	* gw/wml_compiler.c: More little fixes from the code review, also 
	a bug fix.

2000-03-21  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gw/smsc_cimd.c, gw/smsc_emi.c, gw/smsc_fake.c, gw/smsc_p.h,
	gw/smsc_sema.c, gw/smsc_smpp.c: Removed unused field "latency".

2000-03-21  Tuomas Luttinen  <tuo@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/octstr.c: a bug fixed in the octstr_delete; now the 
	\0-character is added in the end.

Tue Mar 21 14:41:01 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* utils/kannel-nag, utils/changelog-report, utils/daily-patch:
	Added to CVS so that interested people can look at them. Don't
	run them without asking.

2000-03-21  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* gw/bearerbox.c: Deleted assertion in http_admin_command.  It is
	valid for `list' to be NULL if there are no CGI arguments.

2000-03-21  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* utils/kannel-init.d: Added some configuration options at the top.
	It now controls my local Kannel setup without problems.

Tue Mar 21 13:43:50 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wtp.c: Converted to use new list instead of (broken) old 
	custom list.

2000-03-21  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.com>

	* utils/run_kannel_box.c: Make it remove its pidfile when it dies.

	* utils/kannel-init.d: New script file to start and stop Kannel
	(suitable for use in /etc/init.d)

	* utils/start-stop-daemon.c, utils/start-stop-daemon.8: Utility
	used by kannel-init.d, taken from dpkg source.

	* Makefile.in: Added entry for start-stop-daemon.

Tue Mar 21 12:57:35 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/list.[ch]: Wrote function list_extract_first.
	
	* gw/wsp.c: Modified to use list_extract_first instead of doing
	it manually with list_lock/unlock and list_len and list_get
	and list_delete.

Tue Mar 21 12:38:52 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wsp.c, gw/wsp_machine-decl.h, gw/wsp_state-decl.h: Converted
	more lists to use gw/list.h. While debugging this (hey, 0 is
	not true, is it?) also implemented wsp_machine_dump.
	
	* gw/list.[ch]: NOTE: Changed interface to list_search (comparison
	function must now return true (non-zero) for item). Also wrote
	list_search_all.

2000-03-20  Tuomas Luttinen  <tuo@wapit.com>

	* gw/wml_compiler.h: Minor code review fixes. The third argument of 
	wml_compile (Octstr **scripts) were deleted.

	* gw/wml_compiler.c: Lots of little code review fixes, yet more to 
	come. Added a patch to remove a bug in the variable handling. 
	Functions text_strip_blank and text_shrink_blank moved into the 
	octstr.[ch].

	* gw/wsp_http.c: Changed to use wml_compile with two arguments.

	* gwlib/octstr.[ch]: octstr_strip_blank and octstr_shrink_blank
	moved from wml_compiler.c.

	* test/wml_tester.c: Changed to use wml_compile with two arguments.

2000-03-20    <Kalle Marjola <rpr@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/http.c: fixed bug in header_pack pointed out by Paul
	Keogh. Also fixed a major too-early free in request_wrap, which
	caused segmentation faults in heavy load.
	
	* gw/*.*: some little fixes/comments

Mon Mar 20 16:56:36 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wapbox.c, gw/wsp.c, gw/wsp.h, gw/wsp_machine-decl.h,
	gw/wtp.c, gw/wtp.h, gw/wtp_machine-decl.h, : Converted from
	hand-made lists to the new generic list. At least partially.
	
	* gwlib/list.[ch]: Added a list_search function (untested as
	yet, though).

Mon Mar 20 15:45:43 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/list.[ch], test/test_list.c: Wrote a generic dynamic list
	implementation. There can be only one, code duplication leads to
	bugs. This is not yet used anywhere, except the test program, but
	I'll start working on converting the wapbox to this next.

Mon Mar 20 15:10:52 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wapbox.c: Function empty_queue_thread: Removed timestamp
	variable that isn't used anymore.
	
	* gw/wsp.c, gw/wtp.c: Marked some places with comments about
	problems, since I had no time to fix the problems yet.
	
	* gwlib/gwmem.c: gw_realloc now checks that the size is non-zero
	and panics if it is zero. realloc(foo, 0) is equivalent to free(foo),
	but this is obscure enough that using it for that is rather likely
	to be a bug.
	
	* gwlib/octstr.c: Made octstr_dump use unsigned chars.

Sat Mar 18 10:40:24 CET 2000	Patrick Schaaf	<bof@bof.de>

	* gw/wsp_http.c: map-url logging tamed, minor code cleanup.

Fri Mar 17 17:49:38 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* Making release 0.6.1.

2000-03-17    <Kalle Marjola <rpr@wapit.com>

	* gw/*.*, gwlib/*.*: numerous little code lookup fixes

2000-03-17  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.fi>

	* gw/smsc_p.h, gw/smsc_sema.h, gw/smsc_smpp.[ch],
	gw/smsc_interface.def: Got rid of obsolete sms_msg.c and sms_msg.h.

2000-03-17  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.fi>

	* Added .cvsignore files to all directories.

2000-03-17  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.fi>

	* wmlscript/wsopt.c: Compress "const_es; return" to "return_es",
	and leave it out entirely at the end of a function (where returning
	the empty string is the default).

Fri Mar 17 10:55:37 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wsp_http.c: Protect calls to wml_compiler with a mutex to work
	around a bug in the compiler that makes it unsafe with threads.
	This is just a stopgap measure, until the compiler can be fixed
	properly.

2000-03-17  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.fi>

	* wmlscript/wsopt.c: Remove dead code after returns, not just
	after jumps.

2000-03-16  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.fi>

	* wmlscript/*: Stylistic changes.

	* wmlscript/wsbc.c: Minor bugfix in verification of bytecode.

2000-03-16  Richard Braakman  <dark@wapit.fi>

	* utils/run_kannel_box.c: Clean up compiler warnings, fix minor
	bug found by rpr.

2000-03-15  Markku Rossi  <mtr@iki.fi>

	* wmlscript/wsopt.c: Fixed some bugs from the assembler stream
	handling.

2000-03-13    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* README: Added notes of smsc_interface.def

2000-03-10  Tuomas Luttinen  <tuo@wapit.com>

	* gw/wml_compiler.c (parse_octet_string): bug fix with parsing
	$-characters. Tried to allocate a huge block and wapbox went down
	on it.

Fri Mar 10 16:48:35 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* Making release 0.6.

2000-03-10  Markku Rossi  <mtr@iki.fi>

	* wmlscript/: Fixed some warnings.

2000-03-10 Sanna Seppanen <sanna@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/http.c: httprequest_execute: memory freeing
	functions added. also changed some error() to warning() -functions

Fri Mar 10 14:52:19 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/smsc_emi.c, gw/wsp.c, gwlib/gwmem.c, gwlib/http.c,
	gwlib/thread.c, test/test_wml.c: Fixed int/pointer size and
	int/size_t size differences in various places.

2000-03-10 Richard Braakman <dark@wapit.com>

	* utils/run_kannel_box.c: New utility, a wrapper that runs as
	a daemon and spawns a given box.  If the box dies, the wrapper
	will spawn a new one.  It will die and kill its box if it
	gets SIGINT, SIGQUIT, or SIGTERM.

	* Makefile.in: add a line for run_kannel_box.c

Fri Mar 10 13:34:59 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* configure.in: Check for xmlDocGetRootElement instead of
	xmlParseMemory so as to find only newer versions of libxml.
	(Fix from Ben Fowler <wapdev@leedsnet.com>.)

	* gwlib/conffile.c: Removed spurious Ctrl-M from end of line.
	(From Ben Fowler.)

2000-03-10    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gw/smsc_interface.def, gw/sms_msg.h: more data about
	SMSC interface

2000-03-10    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gw/bearerbox.c, gw/kannel.conf, test/sample.conf: renamed
	wap-port to wapbox-port and sms-port to smsbox-port, to avoid any
	future confusion. Old names still work.

	* gw/smsc_sema.c: added a name to smsc

Thu Mar  9 11:05:14 CET 2000	Patrick Schaaf	<bof@bof.de>

	* gw/wapbox.c, gw/kannel.wapconf: cleanup, removed
	test-heartbeat-thread logging support from source and config.

Thu Mar  9 19:17:43 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/bearerbox.c: Commented out an assert that seems to be too much.

	* gw/smsbox.c: Added a missing mutex_lock to main_loop.

Thu Mar  9 17:48:33 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* Makefile.in: Moved -D_REENTRANT to before @CFLAGS@ so that someone
	can undefine it when calling configure.in, if they really want it.
	(Also defined to 1, not empty, just in case.)

2000-03-09    Derry Hamilton  <rasilon@tardis.ed.ac.uk>

	* Makefile.in:  Added -D_REENTRANT to CFLAGS

2000-03-09    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gwlib/octstr.c: fixed stupid error in octstr_recv

Wed Mar  8 16:53:24 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wtp.c: Fixed or commented away broken list handling.

	* gwlib/octstr.[ch]: Fixed octstr_search_char_from. Also changed its
	prototype so that the character is passed as an int, since this does
	not cause problems with 8-bit characters on platforms where the
	char type is signed.

2000-03-08  Tuomas Luttinen  <tuo@wapit.com>

	* gw/wml_compiler.c: Bug fix: no more squares (ie tabulator
	characters) in the compiler output.

2000-03-08    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gw/smsbox_req.c: started re-working on UDHs, all new code
	commented out, yet

	* gw/bb_msg.c, gw/boxc.c: added assertions and some extra checking

	* gw/urltrans.c: fixed an error in 'default' rule finding code

	* gw/smsc_sema.h: commented out a function prototype not implemented

Tue Mar  7 16:40:49 CET 2000	Patrick Schaaf	<bof@bof.de>

	* gwlib/http.{c,h}: Added httprequest_replace_header() function,
	use it to overwrite (instead of duplicate) existing user defined
	headers. This gets rid of the duplicate User-Agent: header, which
	convinces some sites to send wml instead of html.

2000-03-07  Tuomas Luttinen  <tuo@wapit.com>

	* gw/wml_compiler.c (text_shrink_blank): A little bug fix. The first
	white space character in a row of them is now converted into a space,
	the rest are deleted before compiling.

2000-03-07    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gw/kannel.*conf: fixed hearbeat as heartbeat

	* gw/bearerbox.c, gw/boxc.c: fixed some memory leaks pointed out
	by Paul Keogh, and added many assertions.

Tue Mar  7 12:51:35 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/thread.c: Added missing #include for <string.h>.

Sun Mar  5 12:53:14 CET 2000	Patrick Schaaf	<bof@bof.de>

	* gw/wapbox.c, gw/wsp_http.c, gwlib/octstr.*: more or less
	completed URL mapping functionality; see gw/kannel.wapconf
	for a short description of the facilities. The device-home
	setting for Motorola Timeport should work correctly now.

Sun Mar  5 10:55:00 CET 2000	Patrick Schaaf	<bof@bof.de>

	* gw/wsp_http.c: change #if 1 to #if HAVE_LIBXML, to really not
	break compilation when libxml is missing.

2000-03-03 Sanna Seppanen <sanna@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/http.c: http_get_u: Should not crash anymore due trying
	to free memory twice

Fri Mar  3 15:50:33 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* README: Added note about CFLAGS settings for development.

Fri Mar  3 14:31:28 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/octstr.c, test/wml_tester.c: Minor fixes to silence warnings.

Fri Mar  3 13:32:30 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/thread.c (mutex_destroy): Destroy the pthread_mutex_t
	when the Mutex object is destroyed.

	* gwlib/thread.c (start_thread): Destroy thread attributes after
	thread has been started.

	* gw/wsp_http.c: Enabled Tuomas's compiler by default.

2000-03-03    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gw/smsc_sema.c: fixed loads of warnings, and one suspicious
	looking comprasion/assignment list

2000-03-02    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gw/*.*conf: renamed old bearerbox.conf, smsbox.smsconf and
	wapbox.wapconf as kannel.conf, kannel.smsconf and kannel.wapconf.

	* gw/*box.c: modified default configuration files accordingly

	* README, doc/dialup.txt: updated documentation accordingly

	* gw/smsc.c, gw/smsc_p.h: added calls to SEMA SMS2000 code

	* gw/smsc_sema.c|h: added support code to SEMA SMS2000 via X28
	link by Hao Shi

Thu Mar  2 12:36:22 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* doc/userguide/userguide.xml: Fixed syntax error (added missing
	end tags).

2000-03-01    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* README: added notes of the new sample files

	* test/sample.*conf: new simple sample configuration files

2000-03-01  Markku Rossi  <mtr@iki.fi>

	* wmlscript/wslexer.c, wmlscript/wsstree.h: Fixed some warnings.

	* wmlscript/wsgram.y: Fixed empty statements.

2000-02-28  Tuomas Luttinen  <tuo@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/octstr.c&h: octstr_create(char *)->octstr_create(const char *)
	* gw/wml_compiler.c: Bug fixes: entities are now supported, no more
	changing URLs into lower case. A bug removed from variable syntax
	check.

at Feb 26 16:57:40 CET 2000	Patrick Schaaf	<bof@bof.de>

	* gw/wsp_http.c, gw/wsp.h, gw/wapbox.c: added configuration
	options device-home and map-url; see gw/wapbox.wapconf for
	a description of how they work.

Sat Feb 26 11:29:10 CET 2000	Patrick Schaaf	<bof@bof.de>

	* gw/wsp.c, gw/wsp_http.c: hacked to start working with
	Motorola Timeport / Phone.com browser. Negotiated client SDU of 3
	is changed to 1350, and DEVICE:home URL is rewritten to something
	else (set DEVICE_HOME_OUT define at top of wsp_http.c to change
	destination to something sensible). Needs work to make the stuff
	configurable.

2000-02-25 Sanna Seppänen <sanna@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/http.c: modified http_post.c. Sending entity length.

2000-02-25  Tuomas Luttinen  <tuo@wapit.com>

	* gw/wml_compiler.c : Now first version of the new compiler with
	variable support. The WML document is first stripped from extra
	whitespace in the beginning and end to avoid parsing errors by
	gnome-XML.

	* gwlib/octstr.h/c : int octstr_search_char_from(Octstr *ostr, char
	ch, size_t pos) added. Does the same as octstr_search_char, except
	start from the position pos. The latter is now implemented as a call
	to the former with argument pos == 0.

2000-02-23    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gwlib/octstr.c: modified octstr_recv to fail if receives
	"garbage" (first length byte something else than 0); this is a
	hack to avoid too large allocations caused by garbage on the
	line. Side-effect is that now the octstr length is limited to
	16777216 bytes when transfered via TCP/IP, but I think that we can
	accept that...

2000-02-22    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gwlib/octstr.c: fixed octstr_dump to show characters in
	'partial' lines, too, and not to show 'empty' last line

	* gw/smsbox.c: changed default configuration file to be as
	'smsbox.smsconf'

2000-02-21  Tuomas Luttinen  <tuo@wapit.com>

	* gw/wml_compiler.c: Some more bug fixes.
	(parse_document): Check added for an empty document (== null pointer).

	* test/wml_tester.c: Now a log file can specified a s an argument.
	* test/test_wml.c: Same as above.

Mon Feb 21 15:20:39 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* README, doc/userguide/userguide.xml: Documented requirement
	to use at least version 1.8.1 of libxml.

2000-02-21 Aarno Syvänen <syvanen@wapit.com>

	* test/fakewap.c: commented tid verification protocol used by the
	program

2000-02-21    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gw/smsc_smpp.c: added receive-port, so that transmit/receive
	ports can be different ones.

	* gw/bearerbox.conf, gw/smsc.c: renamed 'backup-port' as
	'receive-port', old name still functions in the config files, but
	causes warning message. smsc_emi.c still uses 'backup-port' name,
	but life is hard.

2000-02-21  Tuomas Luttinen  <tuo@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/octstr.c: octstr_ncompare doens't anymore check whether
	ostr1 is bigger or smaller than ostr2. It should not anyway.
	* gw/wml_compiler.c: Many bug fixes to the attribute encoding. Some
	possible memory leaks also removed.

Fri Feb 18 21:20:46 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/http.c: Undid changes by Sanna, since they were crashing
	some HTTP calls, and I didn't find the problem within an hour or
	two of debugging. Sorry.

Fri Feb 18 20:07:29 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/utils.c: Don't report debug places unless they're set.

Fri Feb 18 20:05:40 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wsp_http.c: Strip type parameters. This is ugly, but at least
	it will work somewhat if they are there.

Fri Feb 18 19:54:12 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/octstr.c: octstr_dump now also prints the printable characters
	of the string as themselves, so that it becomes easier to read the
	output. The hexacodes are still printed for all characters, of course.

Fri Feb 18 16:40:44 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wsp_http.c: Remove temporary files. Oops.


2000-02-18  Tuomas Luttinen  <tuo@wapit.com>

	* gw/wml_compiler.c (parse_text): Empty strings are no more coded.
	* gw/wml_compiler.c (parse_attribute): Fixed bug with the coded_length.
	Still something wrong with attribute value encoding with one byte.

Thu Feb 17 20:27:54 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* Makefile.in: Removed superfluous libtest.a, which was causing
	trouble with some compilations, making test/wml_compiler pick up
	a random main function.

	* test/test_wml.c: Output with octstr_dump and octstr_pretty_print
	instead of binary if several arguments on command line.

	* test/wml_tester.c: Fixed so that it always has a main function.

2000-02-17  Tuomas Luttinen  <tuo@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/octstr.h&c: argument changed from char * to const char * on
	functions octstr_create_tolower and octstr_create_from_data.
	* test/wml_tester.c: Ouput now uses the fancy otcstr-output functions.
	* gw/wml_compiler.c: Now adds STR_END to the end of the attribute
	value fields and text fields

Thu Feb 17 17:35:11 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* doc/userguide/userguide.xml: Filled in some more. Now most details
	should be copied from the sample configuration files, but things are
	still not explained in a coherent or understandable manner.

	* gwlib/log.c: debug() doesn't print the place anymore. This makes
	debug output readable again.

2000-02-17    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gw/bearerbox.c, gw/bb.h: added max thread BB_DEFAULT.. value,
	instead of hardcoded number

2000-02-17  Tuomas Luttinen  <tuo@wapit.com>

	* gw/wml_compiler.c (parse_document): Standard headers now :
	WBXML version 1.1, WML 1.1 Public ID, Charset=ISO-8859-1,
	String table length=0.

2000-02-17 Aarno Syvänen <syvanen@wapit.com>

	* wtp_tid.c : Fixed a bug in the function tid_cached. Tid_in_window
	rewritten for simplicity.

2000-02-16 Sanna Seppanen <sanna@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/http.c: created the new function httpresponse_wrap, copy of
	httprequest_wrap using octstr. haven't tested it with chunked entities.

2000-02-16    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gw/wsp.c (unpack_caps): fix

Wed Feb 16 14:38:06 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* test/fakewap.c: Changed test for SOL_TCP to actually test the
	macro.

	* README: Added note about CFLAGS may need to be pre-set before
	running configure.

2000-02-16 Aarno Syvänen <syvanen@wapit.com>

	* test/fakewap.c: This version was used for testing of wtp error
	handling and tid verification. Its interface will be simplified.
	Tid_new flag is a now a command line parameter, and it can be turned
	off.

2000-02-16    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gw/wsp.c (unpack_caps): fixed one defination error, added extra
	debug for unknown capabilities

Wed Feb 16 00:04:03 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* doc/userguide/userguide.xml: Started filling in. Nothing useful
	yet, I think.

Tue Feb 15 15:01:45 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* doc/CodingStyle: Documented usage of debug().

	* Lots of files: Removed #if 0 wrappers around calls to debug that
	are now unwanted (the wrappers, not the calls).

Tue Feb 15 14:14:11 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* Changed interface to debug() function: Added a new first
	argment `place', which tells where the function is being called
	from. Then added the function set_debug_places (and made relevant
	changes to gwlib/utils.c:get_and_set_debugs), which sets the
	places which should actually be logged.

	This makes it run-time configurable what debugging output gets
	printed.

	Also changed all calls to debug, to make things compile. The place
	is "xxx" everywhere for now, will start changing that next.

2000-02-15  Tuomas Luttinen  <tuo@wapit.com>

	* gw/wml_compiler.c (parse_attribute): A little more stable compiler;
	doesn't crash when founds an empty attribute text value.

Tue Feb 15 11:16:18 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wml_compiler.c: #include "config.h".

2000-02-15  Tuomas Luttinen  <tuo@wapit.com>

	* gw/wml_compiler.c (wml_compile): A little bug fix. (**wml_scripts
	now exists, so caller won't try to delete unexistent octet string.)

Tue Feb 15 11:07:00 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wsp.c: Broke out wsp_http_thread function into gw/wsp_http.c
	to make it easier to keep the code clean. The old code was rather,
	er, kludgey.

	* gw/wsp_http.c: Moved wsp_http_thread() and dependent functions
	here and started reorganizing it for cleanliness.

Mon Feb 14 16:56:14 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/octstr.c: Added "return -1" at end, since something had
	to be returned and it wasn't returning anything at the moment.

2000-02-14  Tuomas Luttinen  <tuo@wapit.com>

	* gw/wml_compiler.c: At the moment does not accept variables at all.

2000-02-14 Aarno Syvänen <syvanen@wapit.com>

	* wtp*: Compiled with -pedantic. Some of warnings removed.

	* wtp_events-decl.h: Added field no_cache_supported to the event
	RcvInvoke.

	* wtp.c: Argument machine added to function wtp_tid_is_valid

	* wtp_machine-decl.h: Field wsp_event added to wtp_machine

	* wtp.c|h corresponding change to type declarations, constructors,
	destructors and debugging functions

	* wtp_state-decl.h: wsp_event stored until tid is validated

	* wtp_tid.c|h: Added code for tid validation

2000-20-03 Sanna Seppanen <sanna@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/octstr.h: gwlib/octstr.c: minor fixes.

	* gw/smsc_cimd.c: bzero() -functions changed to memset()

Thu Feb  3 18:40:38 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wsp.c: Fixed unpack_uintvar to handle multiple bytes. This
	was embarrassing.

2000-02-03  Aarno Syvänen <syvanen@wapit.com>

	* wtp_send.c: added static functions message_rid, set_rid for changing
	retransmission status of an entire message.

	* wtp_events-decl.h: New event RcvErrorPDU added

	* wtp.c: Tell_about_error returns an event when an illegal header is
	received. Wtp_unpack_wdp_datagram returns event RcvErrorPDU when this
	happens, ditto event unpacking functions. Function machine_find_or_
	create handles this event, too.

	* wtp_state-decl.h: Added rows for handling same event.

	* wtp_send.c: Added function do_not_start for handling aborts not
	feeded to the state machine. Some redundant code added, perhaps, but
	this is simpler than changing all wtp_send_abort calls.

2000-02-02  Tuomas Luttinen  <tuo@wapit.com>

	* gw/wml_compiler.c (parse_attribute): Little bug fix: end tag added
	to attribute lists.

2000-20-02 Sanna Seppanen <sanna@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/octstr.h, gwlib/octstr.c: added search functions for given
	char & string.

2000-02-02  Derry Hamilton  <rasilon@tardis.ed.ac.uk>
       * gw/smsc.c, gw/smsc_cimd.c, gw/smsc_emi.c, gw/wml.c, utils/OTAbitmap.c,
         utils/wbmp.c: all bzero functions changed to memset.

2000-02-02  Tuomas Luttinen  <tuo@wapit.com>

	* gw/wml_compiler.c : Basic functions in order, can be used
	with basic WML pages without variables.
	* test/wml_tester.c : Little fixes to output format

Wed Feb  2 13:52:14 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* Makefile.in: Added a .c.o implicit rule. This is provided by
	all makes automatically, but not all of them make the object
	file go to the same directory as the source file, and instead
	put them into the current working directory. The rest of our
	Makefile assumes the latter behavior.

2000-02-02    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gw/bearerbox.c: updated XML to be synchronized with Plectra

2000-01-31  Markku Rossi  <mtr@iki.fi>

	* wmlscript: Lots of code review changes.  Implemented IEEE 754
	binary floating point encoding and decoding.  Implemented
	WMLScript byte-code disassembler.

	* configure.in: Ported to NetBSD.

2000-01-30  Patrick Schaaf <bof@bof.de>

	* gw/wapbox.c: synchronize put_msg / remove_msg using a mutex,
	removing the need for usleep(10ms). Consequently, make heartbeat
	message send a thread of its own. Set test-heartbeat-thread
	to 1 in wapbox.wapconf to see lots of debugging output.
	* gw/wapbox.wapconf: add documentation about temporary
	test-heartbeat-thread setting.

2000-01-30  Patrick Schaaf <bof@bof.de>

	* gw/wapbox.c: fixed race condition when starting empty_queue_thread.
	BTW, that function seems to burn CPU like hell.

2000-01-28  Tuomas Luttinen  <tuo@wapit.com>

	* gw/wml_compiler.c : Some little fixes.
	* test/wml_tester.c : Some bug fixes, no more core dump, not
	working yet correctly thou.

2000-1-28 Aarno Syvänen <syvanen@wapit.com>

        * wtp.c: Important trivial change: error message "no concatenation
	supported" changed to "no connectionless mode nor concatenation
	supported"

Fri Jan 28 17:13:47 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* Making release 0.5.

Fri Jan 28 17:10:12 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wsp.c, gw/wsp.h, gw/wsp_events-decl.h, gw/wsp_state-decl.h,
	gwlib/http.c, gwlib/http.h: Use HTTP headers from Connect or
	Get PDUs (and add WML and WMLScript content types if they aren't
	already, and the compiled forms are).

Fri Jan 28 13:14:52 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wapbox.c: Only dump non-heartbeat messages.

	* gw/wsp_events-decl.h, gw/wsp_machine-decl.h: Now these headers
	check at top of file that the required macros are defined and
	complain with #error otherwise. Related changes to files that
	include the headers.

	* gw/wsp.c: Headers from Connect PDU are stored in the WSPMachine,
	and used in the HTTP request.

	* gwlib/http.c: Removed User-Agent header from those we add to
	the request.

2000-01-27 Sanna Seppanen <sanna@wapit.com>

	*gwlib/http.c, gwlib/http.h implementation of http_post. all bzero
	-functions changed to memset.

	*gwlib/http.c, gwlib/http.h  http_get changed to use http_get_u
	with NULL header pointer.

Thu Jan 27 20:09:23 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wtp.c, gw/wtp.h: Fixed locking of WTPMachine list (the previous
	code had race conditions in it). Introduced wtp_init function.

	* gw/wsp.c, gw/wsp.h: Similarly for WSPMachine list (it was unlocked
	completely) and wsp_init. Also minor cleanup.

	* gw/wapbox.c: Call wtp_init and wsp_init at startup.

2000-01-27  Tuomas Luttinen  <tuo@wapit.com>

	* gw/wml_compiler.c : some little bug fixes

	* test/wml_tester.c : A tester for the new WML compiler added.

2000-1-27 Aarno Syvänen <syvanen@wapit.com>

	* wtp_state-decl.h: Added rows receiving RcvInvoke when the state is
	RESULT_RESP_WAIT. In this case, we simulate a timer: we resend MAX_RCR
	times and then abort the transaction.

	* wtp_machine-decl.h: Attribute result, for result message, added.

	* wtp.c: Constructors, destructors and debugging functions for
	wtp machine rewritten with the previous attribute added.

	* wtp_send.c|h: function wtp_resend_result added. Function send_result
	now returns the sended message.

Thu Jan 27 17:34:53 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/bearerbox.c, gw/html.c, gw/smsbox.c, gw/smsc_emi.c, gw/wml.c,
	gwlib/gwstr.c, gwlib/http.c: Applied Solaris portability fixes
	from Derry Hamilton <derry.hamilton@pa.press.net>.

Thu Jan 27 16:19:35 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wtp.c: Fixed check for length of Abort PDU. Two equals
	signs were missing, probably a typo.

Thu Jan 27 15:37:14 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wsp.c, gw/wsp_state-decl.h: If client sends new Connect PDU,
	disable all old sessions.

Thu Jan 27 14:01:50 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/socket.c, gwlib/thread.c: Hopefully silenced compiler
	warnings on non-Linux platforms.

Thu Jan 27 13:47:34 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/msg.c, gw/wtp.h, gwlib/socket.h: Added includes for
	<sys/types.h>, which is required for <netinet/in.h> on some
	platforms (Linux makes it harder to write this portably,
	since it works with or without it).

Thu Jan 27 13:43:12 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wsp.c: Don't set client address to NULL, just set client
	port to -1, when disabling a session.

Thu Jan 27 13:40:44 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* configure.in, configure, README: Added check for zlib and
	documented it in README.

Wed Jan 26 23:03:30 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wsp.c: Mark WSPMachine unused in case of unhandled event.

Wed Jan 26 22:19:21 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/octet.[ch], gw/boxc.c, gw/wapbox.c: Added a wait time
	argument to read_available, since sometimes we do want to wait
	for data a bit. This matters in the wapbox, since now it can wait
	for data without busylooping too tightly (only once per second),
	but it will still notice when SIGINT is received (with up to a
	one second wait).

	* gw/csdr.c: If we get ECONNREFUSED, re-try the recvfrom. The
	error is caused by a previous syscall for sending a packet to an
	unknown destination, but because it's not possible to wait until
	the error is received, network latencies being rather long, the
	error is received by a later syscall. We just ignore it now.

	* gw/wsp.c: Handle "application/vnc.wap.wmlc" by passing it
	directly to the user.

	* test/fakewap.c: Added calculation of average number of messages
	per second, and minor error message fixes.

Wed Jan 26 20:44:26 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wsp.c: If an unhandled event is TR-Invoke.ind, then send
	a TRAbort.req to WTP so that the phone will know something's
	wrong.

	* gw/wtp_send.c: Don't pack user_data into Abort PDU, since it
	isn't in TRAbort event anymore. (Related to Aarno's change
	below.)

2000-01-26 Aarno Syvänen <syvanen@wapit.com>

	* wtp_events-decl.h: Added event TRInvokeRequire, removed user_data
	from TRAbort

	* wtp_state-decl.h: Handling event TRAbort fixed.

Wed Jan 26 18:14:39 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wapbox.c: Fixed SIGINT reactions so it doesn't wait until
	bearerbox breaks connection when wapbox stops sending heartbeat
	messages after SIGINT.

Wed Jan 26 17:57:32 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wsp.c, gw/wsp_state-decl.h: Fixed compile time warnings
	about unused or uninitialized variables. Had to comment out
	Reconnect handling, because it doesn't seem to work at all,
	and I don't have time to investigate.

Wed Jan 26 16:28:05 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wml_compiler.[ch]: Comment out everything if HAVE_LIBXML
	is not defined by configure. This is needed until everyone doing
	development has libxml installed.

Wed Jan 26 15:13:25 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* configure.in: Check for gnome-xml library, which is needed by
	the new WML compiler.

	* README: Documented need for the gnome-xml library. (Sorry about
	that, I promise not to document anything again.)

2000-01-26  Tuomas Luttinen  <tuo@tuo.wapit.com>

	* octstr.h: functions added: octstr_create_tolower, octstr_ncompare
	* octstr.c: implementation of the new functions octstr_create_tolower,
	octstr_ncompare added.

	* gw/wml_compiler.h: header for the new WML compiler added
	* gw/wml_compiler.c: the new WML compiler added

2000-01-26 Aarno Syvänen <syvanen@wapit.com>

	* Oops, segmentation work stopped

	* wtp_state-decl.h: Added timer rows (now only missing event is Error
	PDU)

	* wtp_send.c: Added parameter abort_reason to parameter list of
	wtp_send_abort (so that function call conforms closely with specs.)

	* wtp.c: Locks added to functions wtp_machine_mark_unused, wtp_machine_
	destroy, wtp_machine_create_empty and wtp_machine_find.

Wed Jan 26 12:01:17 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/csdr.c, test/udp_send.c: Added missing casts to (struct
	sockaddr *) for some socket operation calls.

Wed Jan 26 11:44:12 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* README: Added "touch .depend; make depend" to building
	instructions. Not all makes build missing include files
	automatically.

2000-01-25    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gw/urltrans.c: added some missing initializations which caused
	sendsms to crash

	* gw/wsp_headers.s: added some code to fool code reviewer

Tue Jan 25 17:27:53 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/http.c: Commented out gw_free calls for error situations,
	where it causes a segfault for some reason. This is not a fix,
	it is an ugly workaround, but it should avoid the problem until
	we have time to review the whole memory allocation/freeing
	situation. (The gateway is already leaking memory a lot.)

Tue Jan 25 17:14:12 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/thread.c: Added comments to explain how mutex_try_lock
	works, and fixed a bug that left the mutex locked in case of
	recursive locks.

Tue Jan 25 16:51:43 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wsp.c, gw/wsp_state-decl.h, gwlib/octstr.c: Applied patch
	from francois-xavier.hannedouche@philips.com to provide partial
	support for Post PDU with only one argument. Also adds support
	for enabling a reconnection.

Tue Jan 25 14:59:05 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* utils/seewbmp.c: Added to CVS. Simple debugging tool written by
	Richard Braakman.

	* Makefile.in: Related changes.

2000-01-25    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gw/bb_msg.c: Fixed error in rq_pull_smg_class, which caused
	failure with 2 wapboxes. Hopefully did not break SMS portion.

	* gw/csdr.c: commented out octstr_dump of each incoming message

	* gw/*.*conf: edited them so that no-one can use them without
	editing, should handle loads of basic questions in devel-list

	* gw/*box.c: put an appropriate error message

2000-01-25    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gw/bearerbox.c: One fix more, now the internal smsbox does not
	consume all the CPU it can

2000-01-25    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gw/bearerbox.c: Some optimization to queue watchers, now it
	should not do updates with no effect, hopefully reducing CPU usage
	in a long run.

Mon Jan 24 21:23:43 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* README: Updated a bit.

Mon Jan 24 21:01:50 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* Makefile.in: Fixed install target.

	* VERSION: Marked as non-release version.

Mon Jan 24 20:53:47 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wsp.c, gw/wsp.h, gw/wsp_events-decl.h, wsp_state-decl.h:
	WSP now obeys client SDU size limit. Had to add a pointer to
	the session machine to a WSP event, which caused non-local
	trivial changes.

2000-01-24	Sanna Seppanen <sanna@wapit.com>
	*gwlib/http.h: function added: header_dump.
	*gwlig/http.c: implementation of header_dump


Mon Jan 24 19:06:58 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* configure.in, configure: Look for -lresolv if it is necessary.
	(From Derry Hamilton <derry.hamilton@pa.press.net>)

	* gwlib/socket.c: Portability kludge for Solaris. Should be fixed
	later. (Likewise from Derry.)

	* test/fakewap.c: Moved definition of `ret' inside #ifdef so that
	it doesn't cause an "unused variable" warning.

2000-01-24    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gwlib/http.h|c: added functions header_pack and header_destroy
	and fixed header_dump

	* gw/wsp.c: moved header code into separate module, and modified
	the interface

	* gw/wsp_headers.c|h: added, now decodes header into HTTPHeader
	struct. Decoding only partial, but at least headers sent by the
	7110 are decoded.


2000-01-21   Sanna Seppanen <sanna@wapit.com>
        * gwlib/http.h: function added: http_get_u.

	* gwlib/http.h: implemented http_get_u.
	shortened code for some functions.


Fri Jan 21 19:05:35 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* Making release 0.4.

	* The gateway is now called Kannel. Whee!

	* Changed wapgateway.org to kannel.org, since the name of the
	domain is changing.

Fri Jan 21 18:36:33 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* configure.in, configure, Makefile.in, README.docbook: Added
	--enable-docs and --without-docs options.


Fri Jan 21 14:18:24 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* wmlscript/wsgram.c, wmlscript/wsgram.h: Added to CVS. These
	are the files that Bison generates.

Fri Jan 21 13:42:57 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* VERSION: Bumbped to 0.3. Forgot to do that for the release.
	Stupid me.

	* Makefile.in, doc/arch/arch.xml: Put version number (from
	VERSION) into DocBook documents.

	* doc/arch/*.xml: Minor corrections.


2000-01-21    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gw/smsc.c: added comments of where to add new SMSCes

	* gw/smsc_emi.c: fixed error in return values in submit_message

	* gw/smsc_interface.def: ADDED interface definitions

	* gw/wsp.c: removed some warnings

	* test/fakewap.c: threaded fakewap from Antti Saarenheimo


2000-01-20    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gw/wsp.c: now decodes all headers sent by 7110 except that
	strange 0x01 0x00 at the end of it (against spesifications?). No
	real implementation for that information, yet.

2000-01-20    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gw/bearerbox.c: added missing accept_pending initialization and
	commented SIGINT handling procedure

	* gw/wsp.h: moved WSP header definitions to wsp.c

	* gw/wsp.c: initial header decoding, only debug output yet, and
	only decodes some common headers

Wed Jan 19 13:22:13 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* doc/dialup.txt: Added. E-mail from Roger Willcocks describing
	how to set up a dialup line for use with the gateway.

Wed Jan 19 13:18:22 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/gwlib.h: Added #include "config.h".

Wed Jan 19 11:38:05 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/http.c: Applied parts of patch from Erik Bos. We're going
	to do the header addition stuff in another way soon ourselves.

Wed Jan 19 10:33:39 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* configure.in: Added check for inet_aton in arpa/inet.h, using
	GW_HAVE_FUNC_FROM. This should make things work for Solaris.

Wed Jan 19 10:21:39 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wsp.c: Silence WMLScript compiler tracing info.

	* gwlib/getnameinfo.h: Bugfix: use #ifdef, not #if, to test whether
	a macro is defined.

2000-01-18    mikael.gueck@wapit.com

	* gw/smsc_cimd.c: submit_sms UDH-enabling fix

Tue Jan 18 16:02:49 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* Release 0.3.

2000-01-18    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* test/fakewap.c: Added new program by Antti Saarenheimo

Tue Jan 18 14:06:09 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* wmlscript/wmlsc.c, wmlscript/wsalloc.c,
	wmlscript/wsstream_data.c: Put in patch from Markku Rossi, to
	fix bug in function that compiles from data instead of file,
	and various helpfulness to wmlsc.

	* gw/wsp.c: Use internal WMLScript compiler.

Tue Jan 18 12:55:36 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wsp.c: Use WMLScript compiler as an external process. This
	works, the internal one has problems (or else I have problems
	using it).

	* gw/wsp_state-decl.h: Commented out, at least temporarily, rows
	that handle method invocations before session has been opened.

Mon Jan 17 17:47:37 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wsp.c: Added WMLScript compilation (untested, though), and
	fixed server transaction ID generation (they weren't generated,
	nor used properly).

2000-01-17 Aarno Syvänen <syvanen@wapit.com>

	* wtp.c: Removed goto branches made unnecessary by introduction of
	gw_malloc. Unused variables removed, too.

	* Segmentation work began.

Mon Jan 17 15:38:15 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* AUTHORS, wmlscript/*, configure.in, Makefile.in: Added WMLScript
	compiler from Marko Rossi.

Mon Jan 17 14:42:50 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* wapbox.c: Added signal handlers for SIGINT, SIGHUP, and SIGPIPE.

Mon Jan 17 11:33:22 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* Makefile.in, configure.in, configure: Added support docdir and
	"make install-docs".

	* gwlib/getnameinfo.h: Define NI_ macros unless they're already
	defined.

2000-01-14    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gw/*box.c: Added SIGPIPE as ignored signal

Thu Jan 13 19:12:11 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wtp.c: Renamed memory_error to pdu_too_short error, since it
	wasn't a memory allocation error. Changed the user visible error
	message also.

Thu Jan 13 18:39:46 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* Makefile.in: Added stuff to compile documents.

	* configure.in, configure: Added stuff to check for jade and docbook
	stuff.

	* doc/*/Makefile: Removed.

Thu Jan 13 17:28:50 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wsp.c: Enabled code to use external WML compiler. Name of
	compiler is "./test_wml" or given in the TEST_WML environment
	variable.

	This is a temporary solution until the new compiler works.

	* Makefile.in: Added (trivial) install target.

2000-01-13    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gw/bearerbox.c: added XML getstatus cgi-bin - many fields
	missing, but basic data should be available

Thu Jan 13 12:19:15 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/bearerbox.c, gw/msg.c, gw/smsbox_req.c, gw/wtp_send.c,
	gwlib/octstr.c, gwlib/octstr.h, gw/wtp_state-decl.h, gw/wsp.c:
	Removed some now unnecessary error checking.  Since we use
	gw_malloc, octet string functions (among others) won't fail,
	so there's no need to check and handle that. This simplifies
	code a bit.

	* gw/wsp.c: Added (currently commented out) code to run WML
	compiler as a separate process, to work around a bug that crashes
	it sometimes when compiling several pages during a session.
	(New compiler being written from scratch, so I didn't want to
	debug the current one too much.)

	* gwlib/thread.h: Added "include #config.h"" so that we a
	definition for HAVE_PTHREAD_H is included properly. This fixes
	the bug that reported thread id always is 0.

2000-01-12    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gw/bearerbox.c: added some usleeps

Wed Jan 12 16:06:01 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* Making release 0.2.2.

Wed Jan 12 15:16:49 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* lots of small changes in lots of files: Changed the gateway
	to systematically use gw_malloc and friends instead of malloc
	and friends directly. It shall henceforth be considered an
	error for anything but gwlib/gwmem.c to call malloc or friends
	directly. (Six unchecked malloc calls found during this cleanup.)

	This does mean that the gateway won't report an out-of-memory
	condition to the phone, but at this point that's a better option
	than randomly using or not using gw_malloc and randomly checking
	or not checking whether it succeeded.

2000-01-11    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gw/wsp.c|h: capabilities client|server SDU size, method|push MOR
	and protocol options (partially) now supported. Note tested, and I
	think that rest of the system ignores SDU settings, fix that later.

2000-01-10    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gw/wsp.*: continued capability work

2000-01-10 Aarno Syvänen <syvanen@wapit.com>

	* wtp_events-decl.h: added user_data to primitive TRAbort (WSP PDU will
	use it).

        * wtp_send.c: Corresponding change to function pack_abort. Module
	reorganised by adding static functions tell_send_error, insert_pdu_
	type, indicate_simple_message, insert_tid, insert_rid, insert_abort_
	type, insert_ack_type

	* wtp.c: Function wtp_machine_find_or_create reorganised. Now it can
        handle event RcvAbort, too.  Function wtp_unpack_wdp_datagram
	reorganised by adding static functions deduce_tid, message_header_
	fixed, deduce_pdu_type, single_message, protocol_version, unpack_ack,
	unpack_abort, unpack_invoke and tell_about_error.


Mon Jan 10 15:48:17 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wml.c: Applied patch from Petri Ahonen <peahonen@ahonen.net>
	with fixes to WML encoding.

Mon Jan 10 11:02:33 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* config.h.in, gw/bearerbox.c, gw/smsc_emi.c, gw/smsc_smpp.c,
	gw/wapbox.c, gw/wsp.c, gwlib/thread.c: Silenced compiler warnings
	when compiling with -Wall.

Mon Jan 10 10:10:22 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* Removed automake. Automake makes huge, complicated Makefiles
	that I am rather reluctant to decipher, and I would have had to
	do that to incorporate WMLScript compiler source. So I removed
	the Makefile.am's and made a Makefile.in by hand.

Mon Jan 10 07:36:36 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wsp.c: Fixed function wsp_http_thread so that is handles
	WBMP images correctly (i.e., sends them to the phone).

2000-01-07    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gw/wsp*.c: initial code to handle capabilities. Not finished.

	* gw/wapbox.c: removed double logging (use log-file in
	configuration)

	* gw/bearerbox.c: fixed WAP routing (no more crashes because of
	WAP traffic while connected to SMSC)

Fri Jan  7 18:06:38 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/boxc.c, gwlib/http.c, gw/wapbox.c, gw/wtp.c: Made sure
	variables are initialized (compiled with gcc -Wall -O2, which
	hasn't been done for a while), or removed unused variables.

	* gw/wsp_events-decl.h, gw/wsp_state-decl.h: Added response_type
	member to SMethodResultRequest so that the Content-Type header
	can be communicated to the phone.

	* gw/wsp.c: Set response_type according to what the HTTP server
	returns as Content-Type. Also, don't blindly assume everything
	is WML.

Fri Jan  7 14:47:09 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* Making release 0.2.

Fri Jan  7 12:01:09 2000  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* AUTHORS, NEWS, README, Release-0.2, VERSION, gw/bearerbox.conf:
	Preparing for release.

	* Makefile.am, Makefile.in: Removed stuff from EXTRA_DIST.

	* doc/fakewap-packets.txt: Wrote. This explains the packets that
	the upcoming fakewap program will use.

2000-01-05    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gw/bearerbox.c: fixed memmove calls (thanks to Yuri for pointing
	them out)

2000-01-04    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gw/wapbox.c: removed automatic logfile opening and instead added
	configuration variable log-file and log-level. Also added standard
	command line options identical to smsbox and bearerbox.

	* gw/wml.c: removed duplicate of 'write_variable_value' function
	(original in gwlib/utils.c)

2000-01-03    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gw/wapbox.c (send_heartbeat): added heartbeat sending. And
	changed bearerbox port and host information to default values,
	not undefined. Patvched some files to make it work

Thu Dec 30 17:51:28 1999  Patrick Schaaf  <bof@bof.de>

	* gw/boxc.c, gwlib/http.c, gwlib/socket.{c,h}: reverted
	introduction of gw_getnameinfo() in favour of getnameinfo,
	which is now "emulated" properly.

Thu Dec 30 18:47:19 1999  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wsp.c: WML page is now fetched from the URL specifed in the
	Get PDU and compiled, then sent to phone. Is this a WAP gateway
	yet?

Thu Dec 30 17:55:22 1999  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* Makefile, */Makefile: Removed from CVS, since they're supposed
	to be generated, and not included in the distribution.

1999-12-30    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gw/smsbox.smsconf: improved documentation

	* gw/bearerbox.conf: ditto

Thu Dec 30 17:04:40 1999  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* */Makefile, configure: Ran automake and autoconf and configure,
	thus some file re-generated.

	* NEWS, AUTHORS: Added empty ones. automake requires them.

Thu Dec 30 16:57:50 1999  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* Applied patch from bof@bof.de for autoconf support. Renamed
	LICENSE to COPYING, and various other similar minor changes.

1999-12-30    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gwlib/socket.c: added that missing reuseaddr to
	connect_with_port

	* gw/smsbox_req.c: oops, did not return all working code, now it
	should work as it did earlier

	* gw/smsc_emi.c: some little fixes to udh messages

1999-12-30    <bof@bof.de>

	* more autoconf: compiles on libc5 and libc6 Linux,
	  and Solaris 2.6 with gcc. See README.autoconf

1999-12-29    <bof@bof.de>

	* converted to use automake/autoconf: ./configure && make

Wed Dec 29 22:06:22 1999  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wsp.c: Three bugs in Reply PDU fixed: status code should
	be encoded (200 is encoded as 0x20); the length of the content
	type field should be included; and the high bit of the octet
	that tells the content type should be set.

	After these modifications, a trivial "Hello, world" WML page is
	now successfully transferred to a 7110 phone. Yesh. Any year
	now we will really have a WAP gateway.

1999-12-29 Aarno Syvänen <syvanen@wapit.com>

	* wtp.c, wtp_send.c: Added label WTP and function names in error
	messages.

	* wtp_state-decl.h: More rows added. Now all events expect timer and
	error are handled.

	* wtp_send.c: Added abort_type in the argument list of the function
	send_abort.

	* wsp_state-decl.h: Added rows for handling Get and Disconnect PDUs
	when the state is NULL_STATE (these are needed for restarting the
	wapbox.

1999-12-28    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gwlib/log.*: added log level 'forced' and updated documentary in
	header file.

1999-12-28 Aarno Syvänen <syvanen@wapit.com>

	* wtp_send.c: bug fixing in functions send_ack and send_abort

1999-12-22 Aarno Syvänen <syvanen@wapit.com>

	* spaces around assignment operators added

	* wtp.c: function machine_find_or_create rewritten. We should not
	create a new machine when we are not receiving an invoke pdu.

	* wtp.c, wtp_events-decl.h: TRResult has now wsp_tid amongst its
	attributes

	* wsp_events-decl.h: Superflous events removed

	* wtp_send.c: Internal function wtp_add_datagram_address added, send*
	functions changed respectively. Added functions send_ack and
	send_abort

        * wtp_machine-decl.h: added attribute tid_ve, which tells are we
	doing tid verification or normal acknowledgement

	* wtp_state-decl.h: added rows for handling receiving invoke pdu, when
	state is result_wait

1999-12-22    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gw/smsc.c, conf-files: changed SMSC configuration vairable
	username and password into smsc-username and smsc-password with
	future HTTP adminstration in mind.

1999-12-22    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gw/smsbox_req.c (do_split_send): returned old code until Mikael
	fixes his new one.

1999-12-21    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gw/smsbox_req.c: fixed default username printing problem. Still
	waiting for Mikael to fix that split_send, it is not working
	properly right now.

	* gw/bearerbox.c: little modifications to debug output

Tue Dec 21 15:17:32 1999  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* README.docbook: Wrote. Includes instructions for getting Docbook
	working (on Debian and Red Hat; patches for other systems most
	welcome).

	* gw/wml.c, gw/wml.h, test/test_wml.c: Added to gateway module
	from old smsgateway module. Code written by Peter Grönholm.
	Implements WML compiler.

	* gw/msg.c, gw/wsp.c, gw/wtp.c: Dumping function only prints
	out the relevant parts of the structure, not all fields.

	* gw/anything-related-to-wapbox-wtp-or-wsp: Removed
	extra debugging stuff to make log files more readable even during
	debugging. (Put'em back if you need'em.)

	* gw/wapbox.c: Emptying the queue of message going to the bearer
	box is in its own thread.

	* gw/wsp.c, gw/wsp_events-decl.h, gw/wsp_state-decl.h: Implemented
	some more of the WSP. Now a Get PDU is parsed and a new thread
	is spawned to do the HTTP fetch (which at the moment just reads
	from a hardcoded file, but that's trivially fixable later). The
	thread then sends back a Reply PDU with the contents of the
	(compiled) WML page. However, the phone doesn't accept it yet,
	something strange is going on.

	* gwlib/octstr.[ch]: Wrote function octstr_read_file, which reads
	the contents of a file into an octet string.

1999-12-20    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gwlib/socket.*: added function connect_to_server_with_port which
	binds our end of the socket to given port number.

	* gw/smsc_emi.c, gw/smsc.c: added 'our-port' configuration
	variable to the EMI IP code.

1999-20-12	Mikael Gueck <mikael.gueck@wapit.com>

	* gw/smsbox_req.c: Dropped in a replacement for split_send()
	still without the vital UDH part. Hopefully didn't miss any
	features.

Fri Dec 17 20:08:56 1999  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wtp_state-decl.h: State RESULT_RESP_WAIT actually sends the
	TRResultConfirmation event to WSP.

	* gw/wsp_state-decl.h: State CONNECTING_2 implemented. This required
	rather a little work, since there is no action. :-)

	* gw/wsp_state-decl.h: State CONNECTED implemented, sort of. Well,
	not really. What happens is that the phone sends a Get PDU, and
	we receive it and unpack it in this state, do the http_get call,
	and dump with debug() the result to the log file. This is enough
	to make sure that the PDU is unpacked correctly and the protocol
	works well enough that the phone thinks the session is open and
	it can make S-MethodInvokes. Whee.

	The next step is to implement things correctly, so that events
	are handled while the URL fetch is happening, and so on.

	* gw/wsp.c: Fixed unpack_octstr (it used offset 0, instead of
	what it got as an argument). Changed wsp_dispatch_event so that
	it tries to find an existing, correct WSPMachine instead of always
	creating a new one. Made wsp_unpack_connect_pdu an internal
	function, since it's not going to be used from outside wsp.c.

Fri Dec 17 17:25:18 1999  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wsp.c: use TID of the machine that receives the event,
	instead of generating a new one.

1999-16-12 Aarno Syvänen <syvanen@wapit.com>

	* wtp.c: Fixing still wtp_machine_find_create. Now it can handle many
	  events.

Wed Dec 15 18:43:27 1999  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wapbox.c: Dump message to be sent to bearerbox, for debugging.

	* gw/wsp.c: Fixed generation of variable length integers for
	WSP PDU's.  Old code didn't even resemble correct working.

1999-14-12 Aarno Syvänen <syvanen@wapit.com>

	* wtp_send.c: in function wtp_pack_result, fix errors in packing wtp
	pdu fields.

Tue Dec 14 17:05:05 1999  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wtp_send.c: Set destination address as the phone, not the
	gateway (and source address as the gateway, not the phone) when
	sending a message to the phone.

Tue Dec 14 16:34:39 1999  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wsp.c, gw/wtp.c: Fixed calls to mytex_try_lock (which
	returns -1, not EBUSY, when the lock failed).

Mon Dec 13 20:47:28 1999  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/bb_msg.c, gw/bb_msg.h, gw/bearerbox.c, gw/smsbox.c,
	gw/smsc.c, gw/smsc_p.h, gw/wapbox.c, gw/wsp.c, gw/wsp.h,
	gw/wsp_machine-decl.h, gw/wtp.c, gw/wtp.h, gw/wtp_machine-decl.h,
	gwlib/thread.c, gwlib/thread.h: Replaced pthread_mutex_t with
	Mutex (defined in gwlib/thread.h), so that the evil kludge to work
	around pthread_mutex_trylock can be hidden inside gwlib/thread.c.
	This required touching lightly lots of code, but it should
	work now. Sorry if I broke anything.

Mon Dec 13 19:31:56 1999  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wapbox.c, gw/wapbox.h (new file): Wrote functions for
	keeping a queue of messages to be sent to the bearer box.

	* gw/wtp_send.c: Made use of the message enqueueing function.

Mon Dec 13 18:43:54 1999  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wsp.c: WSPMachine now remembers its own address and port as
	well as the client's; also added session_id field.

	* gw/wsp.c: Wrote code for creating WSP PDU's. Now creates a
	trivial ConnectionReply PDU.

	* gw/wsp_events-decl.h, gw/wsp_state-decl.h: Added field `machine'
	to SConnectResponse event to store the machine to which the
	SConnectResponse handler should send WTP requests. This is
	a kludge but it was (temporarily) easier to do than fixing
	wtp_find_or_create_machine.

	* gw/wsp_state-decl.h: Implemented most of SConnectResponse.

	* gw/wtp.c, gw/wtp.h: : Wrote function wtp_machine_create, which
	gets all relevant information via the argument list. This is
	mostly just reorganizing and renaming the internal name_machine
	function.  This involved changing wtp_machine_find_or_create
	as well.

	* gw/wtp.c: Removed locking of WTPMachine list, since it was
	incorrect and needs to be re-done in a different way. The current
	code has no locking, but at least it works if we're really,
	really careful.

	* gw/wtp_send.c: Commented away the calls to msg_destroy and
	octstr_destroy, since they caused segmentation faults (free
	called to often, or too early). This means yet another memory
	leak, but that's OK for now. We'll have to design a sensible
	way of dealing with memory de-allocation anyway.

Mon Dec 13 16:36:34 1999  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* Makefile: test programs are also removed by "make clean".

	* gw/wapbox.c: Uses a log file (wapbox.log). Debug messages tweaked.

	* gw/wtp.c: Minor tweaking and bug fixing. Fixed wtp_next_tid:
	It shouldn't get the next or current tid as its argument,
	but use a static variable instead.  wtp_event_destroy is
	commented out to avoid problems with freeing things too early.
	wtp_event_dump output tweaked so it's clearer.	All debug messages
	say they come from WTP now; this helps reading long log files.
	WTPMachine.tcl is now set. Log file functions now don't get
	`errno' as their argument when it's not relevant (this cleans
	up log files quite a bit). New debugging message sprinkled
	all over the code. Added kludge to wtp_handle_event to avoid
	problem with pthread_mutex_trylock (see comment). Fixed problem
	wtp_handle_event so it uses machine->state and event->type
	(instead of separate variables that need to be kept up to date
	separately).

	* gw/wtp.h: Fixed prototype for wtp_tid_next.

	* gw/wtp_state-decl.h, state LISTEN: Actually sends the WSPEvent
	it generates to WSP, using wsp_dispatch_event (new function,
	see below).

	* gw/wtp_machine-decl.h: Added field `locker' as part of kludge
	for pthread_mutex_trylock.

	* gw/wsp.c: Lots of changes. Keeps list of WSPMachines (but
	doesn't use it yet). WSPEvent dumping improved. Wrote function
	wsp_dispatch_event to make it simpler for WTP to send events
	(current version doesn't yet try to find the correct WSPMachine,
	but always creates a new one). Lots of debugging messages
	sprinkled throughout the code. Added similar pthread_mutex_trylock
	kludge as for WTP in wsp_handle_event. Fixed bug in identifying
	the type of a WSP packet (got 0 and 1 wrong, stupid me).

	* gw/wsp.h: Added prototype for wsp_dispatch_event and missing
	#defines for WSPMachine definition.

	* gw/wsp_events-decl.h: Added event SConnectResponse.

	* gw/wsp_state-decl.h: NULL_STATE now implemented (only a lot of
	states more...).

	* gw/wsp_machine-decl.h: Added new fields for client address
	and port (for wsp_dispatch_event routing), locker (for kludge)
	and next (for keeping a list of WSPMachines).

	* gwlib/thread.c: Removed unnecessary empty lines from end.

1999-07-12 Aarno Syvänen <syvanen@wapit.com>

	* wtp.c: fixed locking bugs in functions wtp_machine_*

	* wtp.c, wtp.h, wtp_state-decl.h: fixed wsp handle

	* changing debugging functions all the time

1999-03-12 Aarno Syvänen <syvanen@wapit.com>

	* gwlib/thread.c: added function mutex_destroy

	* wtp.c: Added (uncommented) list locks in functions wtp_machine_*.
	Now these functions panic when mutexes are not iniatilized.

	* wtp.h: updated external function comments

1999-01-12 Aarno Syvänen <syvanen@wapit.com>

	* wtp.c: fixed a bug in wtp_machine_find (now it actually does find
	a machine)

	* wtp.c: implemented wtp_tid_next and added global variable gen_tid
	(it is used as a transaction handle).

	* purely estetical changes everywhere (prettier comments, etc.)

1999-30-11 Aarno Syvänen <syvanen@wapit.com>

	* wtp_state-decl.h: added event receive abort pdu

Tue Nov 30 17:37:58 1999  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wsp.c: Replaced call to malloc with call to gw_malloc.

Tue Nov 30 17:13:36 1999  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wtp.c, gw/wtp.h, gw/wtp_machine-decl.h: Added event queues
	to WTPMachine and wtp_handle_event.

Tue Nov 30 16:33:29 1999  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wsp.c, gw/wsp.h: Implemented wsp_handle_event (doesn't really
	work yet, needs wsp_state-decl.h first).

	* gwlib/thread.[ch]: Added mutex_try_lock.

Tue Nov 30 14:51:01 1999  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* Makefile: fixed "make depend" to add the directory of the object
	file to the .depends file.

1999-11-30 Aarno Syvänen <syvanen@wapit.com>

	* wsp_events-decl.h: added fields for wsp pdu type and event handle
	(unnecessary but mandatory). WSPEvent data structure represents both
	WTP primitive and WSP event.

Mon Nov 29 19:33:42 1999  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/wtp.h: wtp_handle_event will call wsp_handle_event (not yet
	written) instead of returning the WSPEvent, changed the return type
	to void. Moved WTPTimer definition back to wtp_timer.h. Simplified
	code by only using the pthreads version places where there was a
	choice. Added wtp_machine_create and wtp_tid_next prototypes.

	* gw/wtp.c, gw/wtp_timer.h, gw/wapbox.c, gw/wtp_machine-decl.h:
	Related changes.

	* gw/wtp_send.c: Added static to local function.

	* gw/wsp_state-decl.h: Replaced pseudo code function with more
	detailed code to generate events for WTP.

1999-11-29    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gw/smsbox_req.c: added that 'return' to smsbox request if
	max-messages was set to '0'

Mon Nov 29 17:17:44 1999  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* gw/bearerbox.conf: Replaced interface-name's IP number with *,
	so that it works on other machines as well.

	* gw/wsp.c, gw/wsp.h, gw/wsp_machine-decl.h, gw/wsp_state-decl.h:
	Wrote.

	* gw/wtp.c, gw/wtp.h: Moved and renamed things for wsp stuff.

	*

1999-11-29 Aarno Syvänen <syvanen@wapit.cm>

	*header files reorganized so that (most) types are defined in wtp.h

	*wtp_send.c: added a prototype result PDU packing function

1999-11-29    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gwlib/octstr.c, gw/*box.c: modified octstr_recv to return 1 for
	data and 0 for EOF. Changed boxes accordingly

1999-11-29    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gwlib/*: renamed gwlog as log and separated socket functions to
	own module 'socket.c'. Renamed remaining wapitlib as 'utils'

	* */*.c, */*.h: removed last wapitlib.h references

1999-11-29    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gw/smsbox_req.c: added sender username for sendsms request log
	output

	* gw/urltrans.c: fixed swapped receiver and sender

	* gwlib/*.*: split wapitlib into several parts, some splitting
	still possibly. All projects should work but those including
	wapitlib.h should be converted to use gwlib.h instead

1999-11-26    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gwlib/gwmem.*, gwlib/gwlib.h: Added new dynamic memory handling
	functions. All programs should be modified to use these. They
	simply PANIC if the allocation fails, so need to check their
	return value.

1999-11-26  Aarno Syvänen <syvanen@wapit.com>

	*wtp_state-decl.h: Added new rows in the state table (enough to run
	wtp proto).

1999-11-25  Aarno Syvänen <syvanen@wapit.com>

	*wtp.c: Fixed another bug in the function handle_event. No it generates
	only one indication, even though it receives many invoke messages.

1999-11-25    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* gwlib/gwlib.h: added general gwlib header, which includes all
	parts of gwlib

	* */*.c: modified most of the modules to use new gwlib.h. Old ones
	still work

Thu Nov 25 15:49:13 1999  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* gw/smsc_p.h: Added a missing include for signal.h to get the

1999-11-15    <mikael@wapit.com>

	* smsc*.(c|h), *box.c: getting rid of the SMSMessage structure
