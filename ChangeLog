2012-05-31 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: removed meta-data from smsc group because it
      is not supported there.

2012-05-23 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c: added workaround for deferred=0.

2012-05-16 Andreas Fink <andreas at fink.org>
    * gw/smsc_at.c gw/smsc_at.h gwlib/cfg.def: implemented ability to disable
    hardware flow control from the computer side due to some broken modems
    who not simply ignore hardware flow control but actually wire it in the
    way that if its enabled, flow is always disabled. You can now
    say hardware-flow-control = 0 in the modem definition to let the computer
    ignore that fake signal. Note this is not the same as enable-hwhs which is the
    AT command to tell the modem to actually use flow control. hardware-flow-control
    is the hardware flow control for the computer side.

2012-04-20 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsbox.c: fixed issue with shut down of smsbox.

2012-04-19  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: adding documentation for escape code %x
      applicable for 'access-log-format' in the 'group = core' context.
    * gw/bb_alog.c: adding escape code %x for 'access-log-format' pattern
      handling, which substitutes to the smsbox-id. Reformated the function
      to comply with CodingStyle standards.
      
2012-04-08 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsbox.c: fixed double free bug for post request.
      Thanks to Bartlomiej Balcerek <Bartlomiej.Balcerek at pwr.wroc.pl>
      for bug report.

2012-04-06 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * doc/arch/arch.xml: fixed #354.

2012-04-06 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * doc/arch/arch.xml: fixed #355.

2012-04-06 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: fixed default source and destination addr
      ton. This fixes #636.

2012-03-28  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsbox.c: fix minor compiler warning. NLC.
    
2012-03-21 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_http.c, gwlib/cfg.def, doc/userguide/userguide.xml:
      added new option 'generic-param-dlr-err' to pass dlr-err for DLR.

2012-03-21 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_http.c: don't convert HTTP dlr errorcode as stated in SMPP
      spec because HTTP is not SMPP. Just pass dlr errorcode as is to smsbox
      in ?dlr? meta data group, similar to other smsc modules.

2012-03-21 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_http.c: request DLR also if conndata->dlr_url is set.

2012-03-21 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_http.c: write the whole URL, with query string by debugging.

2012-03-21 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/meta_data.h: added some defines to use for meta data.

2012-03-08  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/bb_boxc.c: fix MO routing logic implied by 'smsbox-route' context. We
      have been passing MOs that had a strict smsbox-id routing decission to
      an random not-identified smsbox if there was no smsbox-id connection.
      This breaks the MO routing criteria. Now we obey the smsbox-id routing
      decission and re-inject the MO message rather back to the main queue.
      This patchset fixes bug #633.
      
2012-03-07 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * contrib/kannel-monitor/index.php, contrib/kannel-monitor/xmltoarray.php:
      This patch adds replaces the <? to <?php to fully support when open tags
      are not configured. This patch fixes #250.
      Thanks to Renato Jop for this patch. 

2012-02-23 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * acinclude.m4, configure: added GIT version check

2012-02-21 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * test/test_http_server.c: allow define custom response headers.

2012-02-15  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_http.c: inject 'text' and username variables to DLR message
      passed back to a smsbox connection. This harmonizes the behaviour to be
      similar as for the SMPP client module part.
      
2012-02-08 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * wap/wtls_pdu.c: fixed possible segfault.
      Thanks to Armindo Antunes <armindo.antunes at gmail.com> for this patch.

2012-02-02 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>

2012-01-25  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * configure: fixing autoconf generated script from Andreas, which breaks
      the 'config.nice' re-configuration handling. Seems to be the autoconf
      version related. NLC.

2012-01-24 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c: fixed compiler warnings

2012-01-16  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_[http|smpp].c: again, minor source code changes to follow
      our doc/CodingStyle rules! NLC.
      
2012-01-12 Andreas Fink <afink at smsrelay.com>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c: proper handling of network_error_code. Kannel assumed
      it was the same 3 characters as in the delivery report string but 
      spec says something else so its properly converted now. 
      Whitespace changes (removed tabs).
    * ChangeLog. Corrected Stipe's year

2012-01-07  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_http.c: slight code change from Andrea's previous commit. We
      don't need to allocate more variables on the stack as we have a temp 
      Ocstr* already. NLC.
      
2012-01-07 Andreas Fink <afink at smsrelay.com> 
    * gw/smsc/smsc_http.c: added new parameter for DLR named dlr-err which can
      contain a network error code which is parsed the same way the err: field
      in SMPP delivery reports are parsed.
    * configure[.in]: added support for MacOS X 10.7 Lion SDK.

2011-11-09 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/octstr.c, gwlib/octstr.c.debug: fixed segfault on some systems where
      long overflow occurs. This fixes #623.
      Thanks to Lutalo Joseph Willrich for patch.

2011-10-31 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * reverted commited that moved .foreign_id injection from dlr_add() because
      it breaks other SMSC module as SMPP.

2011-10-26 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * wmlscript/wsgram.y: fixed compilation error.

2011-10-13  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * configure[.in]: need to test for <sys/ucontext.h>, tbough it is defined 
      in IEEE Std 1003.1-2001/Cor 2-2004 it is not fully portable, i.e. OpenBSD
      and Cygwin lack the functionality.
    * gw-config.h.in: add HAVE_UCONTEXT macro.
    * gw/shared.c: add header include to fix implicite declaration warning. NLC.
    * gwlib/utils.c: include <sys/ucontext.h> only if the system has user 
      context support, fix minor compiler warning. 
      
2011-10-11 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/log.[ch], gwlib/utils.[ch]: extracted backtrace output into extra
      function. Added fatal signal handler in order to be able to trace segfaults.

2011-10-11  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c: moved .foreign_id injection from dlr_add() to the
      submit_sm_resp PDU handling code, otherwise we would ONLY see foreign IDs
      in the access-log IF DLR have been requested. Now we see them in any case.
    * gw/dlr.c: remove .foreign_id injection code in dlr_add(), due that this is
      the wrong place to do it. If the user didn't request a DLR, we still want
      to pickup the foreign ID and use it, at least in the access-log i.e.
    
2011-10-09 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c: fixed encoding of LATIN1 messages.
      This fixes #613.
      Thanks to Anders B for this patch.

    * gw/smsbox.c: fixed double charset processing for POST requests.
      This fixes #615.

2011-10-09 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/bearerbox.c, gw/shared.[ch], gw/smsbox.c, gw/wapbox.c, gwlib/gwlib.[ch], gwlib/utils.c:
      This patch should fix issues with restart HTTP command.

2011-10-06  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_http.c: fix default DLR storing behaviour for 'generic' type.
      We shall always store the DLR temp data in a successful transmission,
      even if no 'generic-foreign-id-regex' is given. If it is given, then we
      try to regex scan it and use it for the DLR temp data, if not, then store
      our own UUID as reference ID of the message. This ensures generic behaves
      the same way as type kannel.

2011-09-30 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_at.c: fixed double reencoding issue when message retried
      again after the failure.

      patch that allows setting of esm_class in SMPP module.
      Thanks to Alan McNatty <alan at catalyst.net.nz> for the patch.

2011-09-13  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_http.c: fixed double hex encoding for system type 'kannel'
      and 'no-sep = yes'. Due that we manipulate the msg->sms.[udh|msg]data
      directly, and the msg is re-queued in case of a HTTP call failure we get
      perform the hex encoding again, which results in a truncated content.
      We need to perform the transcoding on a copy and keep the original.
      Thanks to Paulo Correia <paulo.correia at go4mobility dot com>.

2011-05-20  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_loopback.c: after switching the MT to an MO message
      we want to clean up any MT specific values, that are still present
      due to the duplication of the message. This is semantically cleaner.

    * configure.in: added MacOSX10.6.sdk 

2011-05-11 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>

      Thanks to Alejandro Guerrieri <aguerrieri at kannel.org> for this patch.

2011-03-30 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * applied patch that fixes some issues for HTTP-SMSC:
      1) added support for max-pending-submits , so that we don't eat all our
         file descriptors if we have much traffic
      2) changed open_sends from long to Counter, avoid race conditions
      3) start new sender_thread because otherwise we are unable to limit max pending
         submits and if throughput is set we block the whole bearerbox instead of only
         one SMSC
      4) changed shutdown sequence to run safe in parallel

2011-03-30 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * applied patch that fixes DDos issue with our HTTP-Server implementation
      (consume all available file descriptors) and also adds possibility to
      set keep alive timeout for each listen port.

This patch will limit maximum open client connections to 500. 

2011-03-25  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/dbpool_sqlite3.c: ensure we handle the sqlite3 version >= 3.3.9
      function call switching via #if pre-processor macro so we choose either
      sqlite3_prepare_v2() if we do have a local sqlite3 version that supports
      it. This ensures we build again on CentOS 5.x ie.

2011-03-21 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/log.c: Comparing a va_list with NULL is bogus. It's supposed to be treated like
      an opaque type and only be manipulated with va_* accessors. This fixes #587.

2011-03-12  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_http.c: reverting back last commit due to veto if Alex. Need

      fixed destination number prefix handling.

2011-03-08 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/list.c: applied patch which fixes a rare memory leak.
      When the destroy is called, it extracts until a NULL is found, which may
      not necessarily be the last item in the list as gwlist allows you to add
      NULL items to it.
