			<title>3  About the Alligata  Server</title>
			<section>
				<title>3.1 What is the Alligata Server?
</title>
				<para>The Alligata Server is two applications in one: a WAP gateway and an SMS server.
</para>
				<para>As a WAP gateway, the Alligata Server is an entry point to the Mobile Internet. If you are a system administrator, you can use it to link your company&apos;s employees&apos; or clients&apos; mobile WAP phones to a local intranet or to the whole Mobile Internet. By using your own installation of the Alligata Server rather than a WAP gateway belonging to a telephone network operator or an Internet Service Provider (ISP), you have complete control over what services you offer your WAP phone users, and you can guarantee they will not be restricted to sites &apos;approved&apos; by a network operator or an ISP.
</para>
				<para>As an SMS server, the Alligata Server allows you to send messages to SMS phone users from a computer workstation, and to implement dynamic SMS keyword services such as retrieval of information from the World Wide Web. Although SMS is much less flexible than WAP, it is available on almost all modern Global System for Mobile Telecommunications (GSM) mobile phones. With its SMS messaging features, the Alligata Server provides limited access to Internet content even to users of non-WAP phones.
</para>
				<para>WAP and SMS complement each other. SMS is simple to use and widely available, but limited in its capabilities. WAP offers richer functionality, but as a new technology it is not yet as widespread as SMS. By offering both SMS and WAP functionality, the Alligata Server is a bridge between established and emerging technologies.
</para>
				<para>The Alligata Server is based on the Kannel WAP and SMS gateway for Linux. Kannel is an open source software project; if you would like to know more about it or contribute to it, visit the Kannel Web site at <ulink url="http://www.kannel.org">www.kannel.org</ulink>.
</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>3.2 The Alligata Server, WAP and SMS
</title>
				<para>This section will help you to understand where the Alligata Server fits into the architecture of WAP and SMS. Before you read it, we recommend you read <citetitle>Your Pocket Guide to the Mobile Internet</citetitle>, included in the Alligata Server package. There you will find definitions of the terminology used by the WAP standard, and a description of how the WAP components fit together.
</para>
				<para>Every WAP phone is configured by default to use a single WAP gateway to gain access to the Mobile Internet. This gateway can be hosted by an ISP, by the phone user&apos;s employer, or by any third party with access to the Mobile Internet. A phone can contain configurations for several gateways, but it can only use a single gateway for the duration of a session. If you want to change gateways, you have to close down your Mobile Internet session, switch your phone&apos;s settings to the new gateway, and reconnect to the Mobile Internet.
</para>
				<para>The conceptual model into which the Alligata Server fits is shown in Figure 3.1.
</para>
				<mediaobject>
					<imageobject>
						<imagedata fileref="images/wapdiagsmall.png"/>
					</imageobject>
				</mediaobject>
				<para>A signal sent by a mobile device is picked up by one of a network operator&apos;s base stations. It is then routed through the mobile network to the Alligata Server using User Datagram Protocol (UDP). If it is an SMS message, it is first sent to the network&apos;s <emphasis role="bold">SMS Centre (SMSC)</emphasis>. The SMSC&apos;s main job is to hold pending SMS messages for recipients whose phones are turned off or otherwise inaccessible.
</para>
				<para>Once the Alligata Server has received a WAP data packet from a client and decompressed it, it uses Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to retrieve data from the relevant content server on the Mobile Internet.
</para>
				<para>On receiving an SMS message, the Alligata Server scans it for keywords and parameters listed in its configuration file (see Section 13.1), then sends an automatic reply to the client device depending on which keyword and parameters it encountered. This reply can consist of static text, or it can be retrieved from a local file, a WAP site or a World Wide Web page.
</para>
				<para>The Alligata Server&apos;s reply to an SMS message is another SMS message. This means that, in principle, it has to be sent to the relevant network operator&apos;s SMSC in order to be routed to the recipient device (or stored if the recipient device is not accessible). Most network operators charge a fee for terrestrial access to their SMSCs, but the Alligata Server allows you to circumvent this if you own a GSM modem, or a mobile phone that includes a GSM modem such as the Nokia 7110 or 6210. The Alligata Server can use the modem to send SMS messages directly over the airwaves. This way, you will get charged the same rates as mobile phone users for sending SMS messages from your computer workstation. See Section 9.3.2 for details of how to send messages using a GSM modem.
</para>

				<title>3.3 Inside the Alligata Server
</title>
				<para>The Alligata Server is a collection of three programs: a Bearer Box, a WAP Box and an SMS Box. In fact, an implementation of the Alligata Server can include any number of WAP Boxes and SMS Boxes, all linked to a single Bearer Box.
</para>
				<para>All incoming messages pass through the Bearer Box. The Bearer Box performs preliminary operations on each message and forwards it on to a WAP or an SMS Box depending on whether it is a WAP or an SMS message.
</para>
				<para>A WAP Box implements the WAP protocol stack on incoming WAP messages (apart from Wireless Datagram Protocol (WDP), which is implemented by the Bearer Box). It decompresses the WAP data and forwards requests to Internet servers using HTTP (see the booklet <citetitle>Your Pocket Guide to the Mobile Internet</citetitle> for more details). It then handles the replies from the HTTP servers, compresses the replies, implements the Wireless Session Protocol (WSP) and Wireless Transaction Protocol (WTP) layers of the WAP protocol stack on them, and sends them on to the Bearer Box. The Bearer Box implements the WDP layer, and sends the replies to the client device.
</para>
				<para>An SMS Box scans incoming SMS messages for keywords listed in the Alligata Server configuration file. It carries out the function associated with the keyword - for example, retrieving a piece of text from a Web page - and sends a reply SMS message, via the Bearer Box, to the client device.
</para>
				<section>
					<title>3.3.1 Program States
</title>
					<para>At any given time, the Alligata Server can be in one of four states:
</para>
					<itemizedlist>
						<listitem>
							<para>Running. The Alligata Server accepts, processes and sends files and messages normally.
</para>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>Suspended. The Alligata Server does not accept any new WAP requests or messages from SMSCs. The Bearer Box does not allow new WAP or SMS Boxes to connect to it. No messages or files are sent out.
</para>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>Isolated. The Alligata Server does not accept any new WAP requests or messages from SMSCs. However, it continues processing messages already in its system, and accepts SMS messages sent via HTTP (see Section 13.2).
</para>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>Shutdown. The Alligata Server performs the shutdown procedure. New WAP requests and SMS messages are refused. Requests already being processed are carried through. When all queues in the boxes have been processed, the Alligata Server closes down.
</para>
						</listitem>
					</itemizedlist>
					<para>You can change the state of the Alligata Server using HTTP administration commands. See Section 8.2.2.
</para>
					<para>There follows a more detailed look at the components of the Alligata Server. You do not need to know this information to use the Alligata Server, but you may find it of interest.
</para>
				</section>
				<section>
					<title>3.3.2 Bearer Box
</title>
					<para>The Bearer Box is the interface between the mobile telephone network and the rest of the Alligata Server. It receives data from mobile phones via network bearer services or SMSCs.
</para>
					<para>On receiving a WAP data packet from a mobile device, the Bearer Box implements the WDP layer of the WAP protocol stack on it, and sends it on to a WAP Box. If a session is already running between the Alligata Server and the client device, then the message is sent to the same WAP Box as previous messages from the device. If, on the other hand, the message is the first to be received from that client in the current session, then it is sent to a WAP box at random. A basic system of load balancing is used to avoid bottlenecks forming in any single WAP Box. Load balancing works as follows: at regular intervals, each WAP Box sends a &apos;heartbeat&apos; message (see Section 3.3.3) to the Bearer Box indicating its load - that is, how many sessions it is currently handling. If this load is significantly higher than the load of the least busy WAP box, then the Bearer Box stops sending requests from new clients to the busier WAP box. When the load of the busier WAP Box has fallen sufficiently, or the load of the other WAP Boxes has increased to near its own, the busier WAP Box starts to accept requests from new clients again.
</para>
					<para>Messages are distributed among the SMS Boxes in the same way as among as the WAP Boxes. That is, the Bearer Box sends all messages from a particular client to the same SMS Box; it assigns messages from new clients to an SMS Box at random; and it uses load balancing to prevent unnecessary congestion in any particular SMS Box.
</para>
					<para>Within the Alligata Server, the Bearer Box acts as a server to the WAP or SMS Boxes. Once running, it keeps a list of all the WAP and SMS Boxes connected to it. This list starts out empty, and is extended as boxes start up and announce their presence. The Bearer Box is in constant communication with the WAP and SMS Boxes via &apos;heartbeat&apos; messages (see Section 3.3.3), and dynamically updates its list of connected WAP and SMS Boxes as new boxes connect and old ones disconnect.
</para>
					<para>As well as receiving incoming messages, the Bearer Box processes all outgoing messages from the Alligata Server&apos;s WAP and SMS Boxes, adapting each message to the bearer service of the client&apos;s network. In the case of WAP messages, it also implements the WDP layer of the WAP protocol stack.
</para>
					<para>Since all incoming and outgoing messages pass through a single Bearer Box, there is a risk of bottlenecks arising when traffic becomes very heavy. The Alligata Server is designed so that the Bearer Box does as little processing on each data packet as possible, thereby reducing this risk (particularly if there are several WAP and SMS Boxes running on different computers).
</para>
				</section>
				<section>
					<title>3.3.3 Communication Between the Boxes
</title>
					<para>Data is exchanged between the Bearer Box and the WAP and SMS Boxes via Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) stream. TCP is a protocol suited for use in wide area networks (such as the Internet), and its incorporation into the Alligata Server means that the Bearer Box, WAP Boxes and SMS Boxes can be run on separate computers, if required. The advantages of this set-up are clear: it means that, outside the Bearer Box, groups of packets can be processed simultaneously, and therefore the Alligata Server can process high volumes of messages very quickly.
</para>
					<para>If the TCP stream between the Bearer Box and a WAP or SMS Box fails for any reason, the Bearer Box notices this and removes the disconnected box from its list of available boxes. Any packets from phones that were routed to this box are then treated as packets from new clients, and redirected by the Bearer Box to an alternative WAP Box. When a WAP Box receives a message from a new client that it identifies as being from the middle of a session, it sends an error message to the client device.
</para>
					<para>A WAP or SMS Box can also go &apos;catatonic&apos;: its TCP stream to the Bearer Box is still running, but it is not responding to any messages. So that the Bearer Box knows when this has happened, WAP and SMS Boxes send &apos;heartbeat&apos; packets at regular intervals, effectively telling the Bearer Box that they are running and functioning normally. If the Bearer Box stops receiving heartbeat messages from another box, it assumes there is a problem even though the TCP stream may still be running, and removes the box from its list. When the ailing box recovers and announces its presence, the Bearer Box reopens the connection.
</para>
				</section>
				<section>
					<title>3.3.4 WAP Box
</title>
					<para>A WAP Box receives data in WDP packets through its TCP connection with the Bearer Box. It implements the and WSP layers of the WAP protocol stack on the packets, and then decompresses them. 
</para>
					<para>Each incoming WDP packet is handled by a single program thread. This thread creates and manages a WTP state machine and, where necessary, a WSP state machine for the packet. The same WTP machine and WSP machine handle all packets from a given client session.
</para>
					<para>If a packet arrives in a WAP Box while the WTP machine for which it is destined is still processing the previous packet, then the WAP Box sets up a queue specific to that WTP machine. This is preferable to creating a new thread for waiting WDP packets, as it reduces the risk of the WAP Box&apos;s thread table becoming full when traffic is very heavy.
</para>
					<para>Once the WTP and WSP layers of the WAP protocol stack have been implemented on the incoming message, the WAP Box converts it into an HTTP request, and sends it to the relevant server on the Mobile Internet.
</para>
					<para>On receiving an HTTP reply from the Mobile Internet server, the WAP Box compresses the reply, implements the WSP and WTP layers of the WAP protocol stack on it, and sends it to the Bearer Box along the TCP connection.
</para>
				</section>
				<section>
					<title>3.3.5 SMS Box
</title>
					<para>The design of an SMS Box is straightforward. An SMS Box receives SMS messages from the Bearer Box via its TCP connection, parses each message in order to extract keywords and parameters from it, and then executes a service according to which keyword the message contains. The keyword is the first word in the message; any other words are interpreted as parameters. See Section 13.1 for more information.
</para>
					<para>If the SMS service in question has a url variable defined in the configuration file (see Section 9.3.3), then the SMS Box sends an HTTP request to the appropriate URL, retrieves the data, pulls out the content between the prefix and the suffix strings as specified in the configuration file, formats this content as an SMS message or messages, and sends the SMS message(s) to the Bearer Box via the TCP stream. The Bearer Box sends the message back to the client device via an SMSC.
</para>
					<para>Other services the SMS Box can provide include sending a fixed text message or the content of a local file in response to a keyword. For more information, see Sections 9.3 and 13.1.
</para>
					<para>The SMS Box also listens for SMS messages arriving via HTTP from computer workstations. It converts these messages from HTTP into true SMS format, and sends them on to the Bearer Box to be conveyed to mobile devices. See Section 13.2 for details of how to send SMS messages from a computer workstation.

			<section>
				<title>9.1 Core Configuration Variables (Core group)
</title>
				<para>The Core group provides general configuration information for the Alligata Server. This information is used by the Bearer Box.
</para>
				<variablelist>
					<varlistentry>
						<term>
							<literal moreinfo="none">group = core 
</literal>
						</term>
						<listitem>
							<para>Group. Introduces the Core group. (Required.)
</para>
						</listitem>
					</varlistentry>
					<varlistentry>
						<term>
							<literal moreinfo="none">user = <replaceable>user_name</replaceable>
							</literal>
						</term>
						<listitem>
							<para>The user name under which the Alligata Server is run. The Alligata Server automatically switches to this user name after it has started. (You must be logged in as <emphasis role="bold">root</emphasis> to start the Alligata Server manually. See Section 8 for instructions on starting the Alligata Server.)
</para>
							<para>Setting <literal moreinfo="none">user</literal> to <literal moreinfo="none">root</literal> is strongly discouraged, as it could compromise the security of the system.
</para>
							<para>Example:</para>
							<para>
								<literal moreinfo="none">
									user = alligata
								</literal>

						<term>
							<literal moreinfo="none">admin-port = <replaceable>port_number</replaceable>
							</literal>
						</term>
						<listitem>
							<para>Administration Port. Gives the port number on which the Bearer Box listens to HTTP administration commands. It can be any value between 1024 and 65535. (It may be under 1024 if you are running the Alligata Server as a <emphasis role="bold">root</emphasis> process, but it is not recommended that you do this.) It is not the same as the HTTP port of the local World Wide Web server. (Required.)
</para>
							<para>Example:</para>
							<para>
								<literal moreinfo="none">
									admin-port = 13004

							</literal>
						</term>
						<listitem>
							<para>Denied and allowed Box IP List. These variables list the IP addresses of WAP or SMS Boxes to which the Bearer Box may, or may not, forward packets. These variables allow you to prevent third parties from intercepting TCP packets as they leave the Bearer Box.
</para>
							<para>Addresses in the Denied and Allowed Box IP Lists are separated by semicolons. An asterisk * can be used as a wildcard in place of any single group of digits, so *.*.*.* matches any IP address.
</para>

						<listitem>
							<para>White List. Links to a file listing telephone numbers of approved senders of SMS messages to the Alligata Server. SMS messages from numbers not in this list will be automatically discarded.
</para>
							<para>The white list file should contain telephone numbers separated by carriage returns.
</para>
							<para>
								<emphasis role="bold">Note:</emphasis> only the last nine digits are read, so it is theoretically possible for unauthorised senders with numbers nearly identical to those in the white list to gain access to the Alligata Server. The likelihood of this occurring is, however, minimal.</para>
							<para>If the configuration file contains a <literal moreinfo="none">white-list</literal>, it should not contain a

					<title>9.3.2 SMSC group
</title>
					<para>For each SMSC with which the Alligata Server is in communication, you must configure an SMSC group. If you intend to use the Alligata Server for managing SMS messages, remember also to set the <literal moreinfo="none">smsbox-port</literal> variable in the Core group (see Section 9.1).
</para>
					<para>Which variables you need to include in an SMSC group depends on the protocol used by the relevant SMSC. Figure 9.3 provides a list of which protocols support which variables. For full details of each protocol, please consult the documentation for the relevant SMSC.
</para>
					<para>AT is the protocol that the Alligata Server uses to send and receive SMS messages via a GSM wireless modem using AT commands. Using a GSM modem circumvents the need for a subscription to an SMSC. Certain mobile phones that incorporate a GSM modem can also be linked to a computer workstation and used to send and receive SMS messages in the same way as a modem.
</para>
					<para>Modems supported by the Alligata Server include the Wavecom WM02 and the Nokia Premicell. Phones that can be used as modems include the Nokia 7110.
</para>
					<para>If you do not want to use the Alligata Server&apos;s SMS features, you do not need any SMSC groups in your configuration file.
</para>

			<title>10  Creating WAP Documents</title>
			<para>The Alligata Server allows you to offer users of mobile WAP devices an access point to the Mobile Internet. You do not need to provide any WAP content of your own. However, you will probably want to set up your own WAP services - either static WML decks, or Common Gateway Interface (CGI) applications that retrieve data and format it automatically as WML.
</para>
			<para>In order to disseminate information on the Mobile Internet, all you need is space on the Internet from which a standard HTTP server such as Apache can retrieve data. In other words, serving WAP data is almost exactly the same as serving Web data. The only difference from the point of view of the content provider is that the data sent to the client must be in WML rather than HTML format. To all intents and purposes, WAP files are Web files, but in a different format to that understood by PC Web browsers.
</para>
			<para>When the HTTP server to which your Internet space is connected receives a request for WAP data, it finds the relevant file and sends it - or, if it is a CGI application, its WML output - to the IP address that requested it. It sends it using HTTP, like a Web file. The IP address to which it sends it is that of a WAP gateway (for example, an installation of the Alligata Server). The gateway compresses the data and sends it over the wireless network to the client mobile device that sent the original WAP request. See Section 3 for more information about what the WAP gateway does.</para>
		</chapter>

			<title>11  Introduction to WML</title>
			<para>This section gives a summary of Wireless Markup Language (WML). WML is the formatting language used to encode WAP documents. Full details of WML can be found in the official WML specification on the WAP Forum&apos;s Web site at <filename moreinfo="none">http://www.wapforum.org</filename>. here we aim to provide you with enough information to get started with WML and create some basic WML documents of your own. The Alligata Server package includes some example WML files, so that you can see how WML works in practice.
</para>
			<para>WML is derived from Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), the tagging system used to format World Wide Web pages; if you are familiar with HTML, you should find WML fairly easy to learn. However, WML is tailored to display information on much smaller display areas than HTML, and to be compact enough to transmit efficiently, in compressed form, over low-bandwidth, high-latency wireless networks.
</para>
			<para>Writing WML is straightforward: you can use either a text editor, or one of the increasing number of dedicated WML editors available on the market. To check the formatting of your WML, we recommend you get a WAP phone, or download one of several free WAP phone emulators from the World Wide Web. 
</para>
			<para>The rest of this section covers the main features of WML.
</para>
			<section>
				<title>11.1 Content and Tags
</title>
				<para>To begin with, here is some sample WML: the file <filename moreinfo="none">logo.wml</filename> from the example site &apos;Static Simple&apos; on the Alligata Server installation CD. If you installed the example WAP sites along with the Alligata Server, you can view this file by selecting &apos;Static Simple&apos; from the &apos;Site Examples&apos; menu (a full guide to the example sites is provided in Section 12):
</para>
				<programlisting format="linespecific">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
 &lt;!DOCTYPE wml PUBLIC &quot;-//WAPFORUM//DTD WML 1.1//EN&quot;   &quot;http://www.wapforum.org/DTD/wml_1.1.xml&quot;&gt;
 &lt;wml&gt;
    &lt;card id=&quot;foo&quot; name=&quot;bar&quot; title=&quot;Static WML&quot;  newcontext=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;3glab.wbmp&quot; alt=&quot;3G Lab Logo&quot;  align=&quot;middle&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;br/&gt;
      This is static &lt;big&gt;WML&lt;/big&gt; text.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/card&gt;
 &lt;/wml&gt;</programlisting>
				<para>This file, like all WML documents, holds two main types of information: <emphasis role="bold">content</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">tags</emphasis>.
</para>
				<para>
					<emphasis role="bold">Content</emphasis> is generally textual information to be displayed on the client&apos;s microbrowser. It is encoded as plain text using the Unicode 2.0 character set. The example file&apos;s content is the sentence &apos;This is static WML text&apos;.
</para>
				<para>Some characters are not included in the Unicode character set, or are problematic to display because they are used by WML for purposes other than text display (for example the less than &lt; and greater than &gt; symbols, which denote the start and end of tags). Such characters are represented by entity references which begin with an ampersand &amp;, and end with a semicolon ;. Some of the most common entity references in WML are:
</para>
				<informaltable>
					<tgroup cols="2">
						<tbody>
							<row>
								<entry>
									<userinput moreinfo="none">&amp;lt;</userinput>
								</entry>
								<entry>less than &lt;</entry>
							</row>
							<row>
								<entry>
									<userinput moreinfo="none">&amp;gt;</userinput>
								</entry>
								<entry>greater than &gt;
</entry>
							</row>
							<row>
								<entry>
									<userinput moreinfo="none">&amp;apos;</userinput>
								</entry>
								<entry>apostrophe &apos;
</entry>

									<userinput moreinfo="none">&amp;quot;</userinput>
								</entry>
								<entry>quotation mark &quot;
</entry>
							</row>
							<row>
								<entry>
									<userinput moreinfo="none">&amp;nbsp;</userinput>
								</entry>
								<entry>non-breaking space
</entry>
							</row>
						</tbody>
					</tgroup>
				</informaltable>
				<para>
					<emphasis role="bold">Tags</emphasis> are the pieces of information held within angled brackets &lt; &gt;. Tags can do one of several things: they can describe to the microbrowser how to format content; tell it to display non-textual items where they occur; or describe an action for the microbrowser to perform in certain circumstances. Tags are not visible to the user of the client device.
</para>
				<para>Many tags occur in pairs, with a start tag immediately before the section of the file they relate to, and a corresponding end tag after it. An end tag always has a forward slash / immediately after the opening angled bracket.
</para>
				<para>In the example file, you can see that the letters &apos;WML&apos; have a <literal moreinfo="none">&lt;big&gt;</literal> tag before them, and a <literal moreinfo="none">&lt;/big&gt;</literal> tag after them. These tags tell the microbrowser to display the content between them in large text. So on your microbrowser, the sentence will look like this:
</para>
				<screen format="linespecific">This is static WML text.
</screen>
				<para>A tag that does not have a closing tag is called an empty tag - empty because it has no content or other tags inside it. An example is the tag <literal moreinfo="none">&lt;img alt=&quot;3G Lab Logo&quot; src=&quot;3glab.wbmp&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot;/&gt;</literal>. This tag tells the browser to display the image file <filename moreinfo="none">3glab.wbmp</filename> where it occurs. Note that an empty tag must end with a forward slash, so that the browser knows not to look for a companion end tag. In this respect WML differs from HTML, so if you are used to writing HTML, remember to include these slashes.
</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>11.2 Elements and Attributes
</title>
				<para>WML tags, like HTML tags, contain information about elements and attributes.
</para>
				<para>An <emphasis role="bold">element</emphasis> is a structural unit of a WML document: every tag begins with an element indicator. In the example file (see Section 11.1), <literal moreinfo="none">wml, card, p, img</literal> and <literal moreinfo="none">big</literal> are all elements.
</para>
				<para>An <emphasis role="bold">attribute</emphasis> provides information about a specific occurrence of an element. Attributes are included in an element&apos;s start tag, after the element indicator. In the example file in Section 11.1, the <literal moreinfo="none">img</literal> element has several attributes associated with it. The attribute <literal moreinfo="none">src=&quot;3glab.wbmp&quot;</literal> tells the microbrowser to display the image <filename moreinfo="none">3glab.wbmp</filename>; <literal moreinfo="none">alt=&quot;3G Lab Logo&quot;</literal> tells it that if, for any reason, it can&apos;t display the image, it should display the text &apos;3G Lab Logo&apos; instead; and <literal moreinfo="none">align=&quot;middle&quot;</literal> tells the microbrowser to centre the image vertically on the card.
</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>11.3 Cards and Decks
</title>
				<para>Whereas HTML documents are organised into &apos;pages&apos;, WML documents are organised into units called &apos;cards&apos; and &apos;decks&apos;. A WML file is a deck, and a deck contains one or more cards. On loading a deck of several cards, a microbrowser will always display the first card by default.
</para>
				<para>A card contains a &apos;screen&apos;s worth&apos; of information. Because most WAP client devices have small display areas, the user will often have to scroll downwards to view the whole of a card; but the card should not be so long that they lose track of where they are. WML&apos;s navigation facilities enable you to jump from one card in a deck to another.
</para>
				<para>Cards are marked up using the <literal moreinfo="none">card</literal> element. There is no <literal moreinfo="none">deck</literal> element - a deck comprises everything inside a file&apos;s <literal moreinfo="none">wml</literal> element. See Section 11.5 for more information on the <literal moreinfo="none">wml</literal> element.
</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>11.4 XML Validation Tags
</title>
				<programlisting format="linespecific">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE wml PUBLIC &quot;-//WAPFORUM//DTD WML 1.1//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.wapforum.org/DTD/wml_1.1.xml&quot;&gt;
</programlisting>
				<para>The tag <literal moreinfo="none">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;</literal> tells the browser that the file is an XML document, complying with version 1.0 of the XML specification. XML is a markup language of which WML is a specialised subset. So every valid WML document is implicitly also a valid XML document.

</para>
				<para>The second tag tells the browser where to find the Document Type Definition (DTD) for files of its type - in this case, WML files. A DTD is an electronic specification for a file&apos;s format, declaring what elements are allowed within what other elements, and what attributes each element is allowed to contain. If the structure of the file does not match the structures allowed by the DTD, then the browser knows that it contains errors, and may display a message warning the user of this. In practice, browsers are often tolerant of errors and will do their best to display files, even if they are not structurally valid. However, you should always try to structure your WML files properly - apart from being good practice, this guarantees that they will display as you intend on all WML-compliant browsers.
</para>
				<para>These two tags are not WML tags, but validation tags instructing the browser to parse the rest of the file as WML.
</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>11.5 The wml Element
</title>
				<para>The top-level element in every WML deck is <literal moreinfo="none">wml</literal>. The <literal moreinfo="none">&lt;wml&gt;</literal> tag announces to the browser that everything following it should be parsed as WML data, up to the <literal moreinfo="none">&lt;/wml&gt;</literal> tag. 
</para>
				<para>Therefore, the first tag in a deck (after the validation tags) should be <literal moreinfo="none">&lt;wml&gt;</literal>, and the last tag in the deck should be <literal moreinfo="none">&lt;/wml&gt;</literal>.
</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>11.6 Paragraphs
</title>
				<para>It is good practice to organise WML content into paragraphs. Paragraphs are defined by the p element. Note that in WML, unlike in HTML, each <literal moreinfo="none">&lt;p&gt;</literal> tag <emphasis role="bold">must</emphasis> have a corresponding <literal moreinfo="none">&lt;/p&gt;</literal> closing tag. For example:
</para>
				<programlisting format="linespecific">&lt;card&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This card is divided into paragraphs. This is the first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is the second paragraph. It is also the last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/card&gt;
</programlisting>
				<para>By default, text between <literal moreinfo="none">&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;</literal> tags is left-aligned. You can centre- or right-align it using the <literal moreinfo="none">align</literal> attribute with the value <literal moreinfo="none">center</literal> or <literal moreinfo="none">right</literal> respectively. For example:
</para>
				<programlisting format="linespecific">&lt;p align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;This paragraph is right-aligned.&lt;/p&gt;</programlisting>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>11.7 Hyperlinks
</title>
				<para>Like HTML, WML allows you to include hyperlinks in your documents. A hyperlink can carry the user to a different place in the current deck, a different deck on the same WAP site, or a different WAP site.
</para>
				<para>How a hyperlink is activated by the user is a matter for the browser manufacturer. A typical implementation might provide two buttons on the device to move a highlight backwards and forwards between hyperlinks, and a third button to activate the highlighted link.
</para>
				<para>The hyperlink element in WML is <literal moreinfo="none">a</literal> (as in HTML, this stands for &apos;anchor&apos;). It takes an attribute <literal moreinfo="none">href</literal>, which indicates the destination of the link. For example:
</para>
				<programlisting format="linespecific">Great oaks from &lt;a href=&quot;http:// www.littleacorns.com&quot;&gt;little acorns&lt;/a&gt; grow.
</programlisting>
				<para>Here, the words &apos;little acorns&apos; are a hyperlink taking the user to the WAP site www.littleacorns.com. On a browser, the hyperlink may be indicated by underlining, in which case the sentence above would be displayed like this:
</para>
				<screen format="linespecific">Great oaks from little acorns grow.
</screen>
				<para>To create hyperlinks between cards in the same deck, give each <literal moreinfo="none">card</literal> a unique <literal moreinfo="none">id</literal> attribute, and refer to that <literal moreinfo="none">id</literal> in the <literal moreinfo="none">href</literal> attribute of hyperlinks to it. In the <literal moreinfo="none">href</literal> attribute, precede the destination card&apos;s name with a hash #: this indicates that the link is to a card rather than to a file.
</para>
				<para>The example file below contains two cards, linked by referring to one another&apos;s <literal moreinfo="none">id</literal> attributes.
</para>
				<programlisting format="linespecific">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
 &lt;!DOCTYPE wml PUBLIC &quot;-//WAPFORUM//DTD WML 1.1//EN&quot;   &quot;http://www.wapforum.org/DTD/wml_1.1.xml&quot;&gt;
 &lt;wml&gt;
    &lt;card id=&quot;card1&quot;&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
        This is a WML card.
      &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;#card2&quot;&gt;Next card...&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/card&gt;
    &lt;card id=&quot;card2&quot;&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
        And this is another.
      &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;#card1&quot;&gt;Previous card...&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/card&gt;
 &lt;/wml&gt;
</programlisting>
				<para>You can also link to a specific card in another deck by appending a hash # and the card&apos;s <literal moreinfo="none">id</literal> to the URL. For example:
</para>
				<programlisting format="linespecific">&lt;a href=&quot;anotherfile.wml#acertaincard&quot;&gt;Go to that card&lt;/a&gt;
</programlisting>
				<para>Here, the link &apos;Go to that card&apos; takes the user to the card acertaincard in the deck anotherfile.wml.
</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>11.8 Tasks (do Element)
</title>
				<para>The <literal moreinfo="none">do</literal> element allows you to incorporate simple interactive features into a WML card, without reference to any particular item on the card. How the user activates a <literal moreinfo="none">do</literal> task depends on the device manufacturer&apos;s implementation of WML. The general idea is that a <literal moreinfo="none">do</literal> function should be independent of where the user has scrolled to on the page, which hyperlink is currently highlighted, and so on. Typically, a <literal moreinfo="none">do</literal> function will be activated by a physical button on the client device.
</para>
				<para>A <literal moreinfo="none">do</literal> element can perform one of four basic functions, depending on which of the following elements is present between its start and end tags. These elements are called &apos;tasks&apos;:
</para>
				<informaltable>
					<tgroup cols="2">
						<tbody>
							<row>
								<entry>
									<literal moreinfo="none">go</literal>
								</entry>
								<entry>Navigates to another WAP deck, site or card, by means of an <literal moreinfo="none">href</literal> attribute.
</entry>
							</row>
							<row>
								<entry>
									<literal moreinfo="none">prev</literal>
								</entry>
								<entry>Navigates to the previous URL on the client&apos;s history stack.
</entry>
							</row>
							<row>
								<entry>
									<literal moreinfo="none">noop</literal>
								</entry>
								<entry>Does nothing. This can be useful for certain purposes, for example, to override a default task set in the <literal moreinfo="none">template</literal> element of a deck (see Section 11.10).
</entry>
							</row>
							<row>
								<entry>
									<literal moreinfo="none">refresh</literal>
								</entry>
								<entry>Resets the current deck to the state it was in when it was first loaded. As well as resetting the visual display of a deck, <literal moreinfo="none">refresh</literal> can also be made to reset variables (see Section 11.11).
</entry>
							</row>
						</tbody>
					</tgroup>
				</informaltable>
				<para>Here is an example do statement:
</para>
				<programlisting format="linespecific"> &lt;do type=&quot;prev&quot; label=&quot;Go Back&quot; name=&quot;goback&quot;&gt;
  &lt;prev/&gt;
 &lt;/do&gt;
</programlisting>
				<para>This <literal moreinfo="none">do</literal> element includes three attributes:
</para>
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>
						<para>The <literal moreinfo="none">type</literal> attribute gives the client browser an indication of what category of tasks the current task belongs to. Possible values include <literal moreinfo="none">&quot;accept&quot;, &quot;prev&quot;, &quot;help&quot;, &quot;reset&quot;, &quot;options&quot;</literal> and <literal moreinfo="none">&quot;delete&quot;</literal>. Note that the type attribute has no bearing on the actual function of the task element: it simply allows the client browser to decide how to display it. For example, the Nokia 7110 WAP phone displays a <literal moreinfo="none">do</literal> element of the <literal moreinfo="none">prev</literal> type in the bottom right corner of the screen and associates it with the right navigation button.
</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>The <literal moreinfo="none">label</literal> attribute tells the browser what wording to assign to the function on-screen. In some instances, a client device may automatically override a label attribute: for example, the Nokia 7110 phone always labels a <literal moreinfo="none">do type=&quot;prev&quot;</literal> function as &apos;Back&apos;, regardless of the content of the <literal moreinfo="none">label</literal> attribute.
</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>The <literal moreinfo="none">name</literal> attribute gives the <literal moreinfo="none">do</literal> function an identifier by which scripting languages such as WMLScript can refer to it.
</para>
					</listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
				<para>Suppose a client device associates <literal moreinfo="none">do type=&quot;prev&quot;</literal> with its right navigation button, and accepts a WML-defined <literal moreinfo="none">label</literal> attribute. On such a device, our example do function might appear as shown in the bottom right corner of Figure 11.1.

				<title>11.9 Events
</title>
				<para>WML allows you to specify automatic actions in a client device that are precipitated by particular &apos;events&apos;. An &apos;event&apos; must be associated with a particular element in a WML file - either <literal moreinfo="none">card, wml</literal> or <literal moreinfo="none">option</literal>. The response to an event is defined by the <literal moreinfo="none">onevent</literal> element, which must occur within the element to which it relates. The type of event to respond to is indicated in the <literal moreinfo="none">type</literal> attribute of the <literal moreinfo="none">onevent</literal> element.
</para>
				<para>Possible values for the <literal moreinfo="none">type</literal> attribute are as shown in Figure 11.2.
</para>
				<para>The action undertaken by the client device in response to an event must be defined by one of the task elements <literal moreinfo="none">go, prev, noop</literal> or <literal moreinfo="none">refresh</literal>. The task element must be situated within the <literal moreinfo="none">onevent</literal> element.
</para>
				<para>For example:
</para>
				<programlisting format="linespecific"> &lt;card&gt;
  &lt;onevent type=&quot;onenterbackward&quot;&gt;
   &lt;go href=&quot;backwardpeople.wml&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/onevent&gt;
  You didn&amp;apos;t enter this card backwards.
 &lt;/card&gt;
</programlisting>
				<para>If a user arrives at this card via a hyperlink or a <literal moreinfo="none">go</literal> task, they will see the message
</para>
				<screen format="linespecific">You didn&apos;t enter this card backwards.
</screen>
				<para>However, if the user arrives at the card via a <literal moreinfo="none">prev</literal> task, they will be redirected to the file <filename moreinfo="none">backwardpeople.wml</filename>.
</para>
				<para>There is another way of handling an event that is shorter, but less flexible. Instead of using the <literal moreinfo="none">onevent</literal> element, you can specify an action in the form of an attribute in the relevant <literal moreinfo="none">card</literal> or <literal moreinfo="none">wml</literal> element. For example, the sample WML above could be rewritten as follows, and would do exactly the same thing:
</para>
				<programlisting format="linespecific"> &lt;card onenterbackward=&quot;backwardpeople.wml&quot;&gt;
     You didn&amp;apos;t enter this card backwards.
 &lt;/card&gt;
</programlisting>
				<para>Note that the only kind of action possible using this method is a jump to a URL (in this case, <filename moreinfo="none">backwardpeople.wml</filename>). This is equivalent to the <literal moreinfo="none">go</literal> action. If you want to perform a <literal moreinfo="none">prev</literal>, a <literal moreinfo="none">noop</literal> or a <literal moreinfo="none">refresh</literal> action, you have to use the longer method.
</para>

				<title>11.10 Templates
</title>
				<para>Suppose you create a WML deck consisting of five cards, and you want a <literal moreinfo="none">prev</literal> task on every card except the first. Rather than repeating the same <literal moreinfo="none">do</literal> statement in each of the four cards - which is laborious for you as a WML author, and uses up precious bytes in the WML file - you can use the <literal moreinfo="none">template</literal> element to specify a task to appear automatically on every card you want.
</para>
				<para>Here is an example of a WML file that uses a <literal moreinfo="none">template</literal> element:
</para>
				<programlisting format="linespecific"> &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
 &lt;!DOCTYPE wml PUBLIC &quot;-//WAPFORUM//DTD WML 1.1//EN&quot;   &quot;http://www.wapforum.org/DTD/wml_1.1.xml&quot;&gt;
 
 &lt;wml&gt;
 
  &lt;template&gt;
   &lt;do type=&quot;prev&quot;&gt;

				<para>When this file is viewed on a WAP microbrowser, every card except the first one has a &apos;Back&apos; link on it - even though, in the WML source, none of them contains a <literal moreinfo="none">prev</literal> task. The explanation for this is that the <literal moreinfo="none">prev</literal> task is held in the <literal moreinfo="none">template</literal> element at the beginning of the file, and is applied automatically to every card in the deck, except the first.
</para>
				<para>The reason there is no &apos;Back&apos; link on the first card is that the first card contains a <literal moreinfo="none">noop</literal> task. Because a task defined in a card always overrides a default task of the same type as specified in the <literal moreinfo="none">template</literal>, and because <literal moreinfo="none">noop</literal> does nothing, this card displays nothing in place of a &apos;Back&apos; link.

				<title>11.11 Variables
</title>
				<para>One of the most interesting features of WML is its ability to process variables. If you have any programming experience, you will know that a variable is a &apos;label&apos; for a numeric value or a string of characters in a computer program. A common use of variables is to store input from a user or another external source - in other words, information that can&apos;t be written into the program itself.
</para>
				<para>Variables in WML enable you to implement interactive features into your cards and decks without getting involved in the complexities of scripting languages like WMLScript. Note that the only variables allowed in WML are strings.
</para>
				<para>There are a number of ways in which you can specify variables. One of the most useful is via the <literal moreinfo="none">input</literal> element, which allows the user to enter information into the client device&apos;s interface.
</para>
				<para>Here is a very simple WML deck that writes a &apos;proverb&apos; based on terms the user enters through the <literal moreinfo="none">input</literal> element:
</para>
				<programlisting format="linespecific"> &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
 &lt;!DOCTYPE wml PUBLIC &quot;-//WAPFORUM//DTD WML 1.1//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.wapforum.org/DTD/wml_1.1.xml&quot;&gt;
 &lt;wml&gt;
  &lt;card id=&quot;card1&quot; title=&quot;Proverb Wizard&quot;&gt;
      Name an animal:
      &lt;input name=&quot;animal&quot;/&gt;
      Name a vegetable:
      &lt;input name=&quot;vegetable&quot;/&gt;
       &lt;a href=&quot;#card2&quot;&gt;
     View proverb...
       &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/card&gt;

  &lt;card id=&quot;card2&quot; title=&quot;Your proverb&quot;&gt;
   &lt;do type=&quot;accept&quot; label=&quot;Another?&quot;&gt;
    &lt;go href=&quot;#card1&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/do&gt;
   A small $(animal) may eat a large $(vegetable).
  &lt;/card&gt;

 &lt;/wml&gt;
</programlisting>
				<para>When this file is opened on a microbrowser, the following card will be displayed:
</para>
				<mediaobject>
					<imageobject>
						<imagedata fileref="images/11-3.png"/>
					</imageobject>
					<caption>
						<para>Figure 11.3</para>
					</caption>
				</mediaobject>
				<para>As can be seen, there are two input fields. These are created by the tags <literal moreinfo="none">&lt;input name=&quot;animal&quot;/&gt;</literal> and <literal moreinfo="none">&lt;input name=&quot;vegetable&quot;/&gt;</literal> in the WML source. The <literal moreinfo="none">name</literal> attributes tell the browser to create the variables <literal moreinfo="none">animal</literal> and <literal moreinfo="none">vegetable</literal> respectively, based on what the user types into each field.
</para>
				<para>To select a horse for the animal and a radish for the vegetable, enter <userinput moreinfo="none">horse</userinput> into the first field and <userinput moreinfo="none">radish</userinput> into the second field. (The actual mechanism for entering text will depend on your microbrowser. For example, it may present you with an <interface moreinfo="none">Edit</interface> option that you activate by pressing one of the phone&apos;s navigation buttons.)
</para>
				<para>The microbrowser display will now be as in Figure 11.4.
</para>
				<mediaobject>
					<imageobject>
						<imagedata fileref="images/11-4.png"/>
					</imageobject>
					<caption>
						<para>Figure 11.4</para>
					</caption>
				</mediaobject>
				<para>Now, activate the &apos;View proverb...&apos; link. A new card is loaded, showing a proverb based on the terms you entered in the first card (see Figure 11.5).
</para>
				<mediaobject>
					<videoobject>
						<videodata/>
					</videoobject>
					<imageobject>
						<imagedata fileref="images/11-5.png"/>
					</imageobject>
					<caption>
						<para>Figure 11.5</para>
					</caption>
				</mediaobject>
				<para>In the source WML you can see how the terms entered in the first card were passed to the second card. The variables <literal moreinfo="none">animal</literal> and <literal moreinfo="none">vegetable</literal> were set in the tags <literal moreinfo="none">&lt;input name=&quot;animal&quot;/&gt;</literal> and <literal moreinfo="none">&lt;input name=&quot;vegetable&quot;/&gt;</literal>. 
</para>
				<para>The source text in the second card looks like this:
</para>
				<programlisting format="linespecific">A small $(animal) may eat a large $(vegetable).
</programlisting>
				<para>When the browser encounters a dollar symbol $, it knows that what follows in parentheses is a variable. So instead of displaying &apos;(animal)&apos; it looks for the variable called <literal moreinfo="none">animal</literal> and displays its value - in this example, the string &apos;horse&apos;. It does the same with the variable <literal moreinfo="none">vegetable</literal>, substituting its name with &apos;radish&apos;.
</para>
				<para>(If you want to display a dollar symbol on the screen, use two dollar symbols $$ in your WML file.)
</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>11.12 Timers
</title>
				<para>You can incorporate a timer into a WML card or deck using the <literal moreinfo="none">timer</literal> element. When a timer runs out, an action is performed as specified in the <literal moreinfo="none">ontimer</literal> event handler. See Section 11.9 for more details about event handling.
</para>
				<para>
					<literal moreinfo="none">timer</literal> takes a <literal moreinfo="none">value</literal> attribute, specifying how long the timer should run for. The value is expressed in tenths of a second.
</para>
				<para>Here is an example timer implementation:
</para>
				<programlisting format="linespecific"> &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
 &lt;!DOCTYPE wml PUBLIC &quot;-//WAPFORUM//DTD WML 1.1//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.wapforum.org/DTD/wml_1.1.xml&quot;&gt;
 &lt;wml&gt;
  &lt;card id=&quot;wait&quot;&gt;
   &lt;onevent type=&quot;ontimer&quot;&gt;
    &lt;go href=&quot;#thankyou&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/onevent&gt;
   &lt;timer value=&quot;40&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
   Please wait.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/card&gt;
  &lt;card id=&quot;thankyou&quot;&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
   Thank you for waiting.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/card&gt;
 &lt;/wml&gt;
</programlisting>
				<para>When you first load this file you will see the message &apos;Please wait.&apos; After about four seconds, the first card will time out and the second card will appear, showing the message &apos;Thank you for waiting.&apos;
</para>

				<title>11.13 Images
</title>
				<para>WML can include embedded images. These must be in two-colour wireless bitmap (WBMP) format. There are several free WBMP editors that can be downloaded from the World Wide Web.
</para>
				<para>To embed an image in a file, use the <literal moreinfo="none">img</literal> element with some or all of the attributes shown in Figure 11.6. For example:
</para>
				<programlisting format="linespecific">&lt;img src=&quot;3glab.wbmp&quot; alt=&quot;3G Lab Logo&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot;/&gt;
</programlisting>

If these attributes are omitted, the image is displayed at its actual size, though the microbrowser will probably not reserve space for it while the card is loading.

If the height and width attributes do not match the actual height and width of an image, the microbrowser either scales the image to match the attributes, or else ignores the attributes and shows the image at its actual size.</entry>

			<title>12  Example WAP Sites</title>
			<para>Included on the Alligata Server CD-ROM are five example WAP sites. If you installed the example sites along with the Alligata Server (see Sections 4 and 5), and you have an HTTP server such as Apache running on your computer, you can view them from a WAP phone or a WAP phone emulator. 
</para>
			<para>The example sites are illustrations of the kinds of service you can implement using WAP. You can create simple sites using just WML, or you can incorporate dynamic features into them using scripting languages like Perl and PHP. The most important thing to remember is to keep the files you serve as small and simple as possible. A compiled WML file should not be larger than 1400 bytes, which means the size of your source WML file should not exceed about 3000 characters.
</para>

				<para>Remember that your microbrowser does not see this data but a compressed version of it that is less easy for a human being to decipher, but quicker to transmit and using less of the client device&apos;s limited memory.
</para>
				<para>The first two tags in the file are the XML validation tags:
</para>
				<programlisting format="linespecific">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;

</programlisting>
				<para>This is the card containing the ACME logo. Because it is the first card in the deck, it is the one that appears by default when you load the file. 
</para>
				<para>Here is a description of the card item by item. 
</para>
				<para>First, you will see that the <literal moreinfo="none">card</literal> element contains four attributes:
</para>
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							<literal moreinfo="none">id=&quot;logo&quot;</literal> gives the card a name by which other cards or decks can refer to it.
</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							<literal moreinfo="none">ontimer=&quot;#menu&quot;</literal> tells the microbrowser that when the timer contained in the card runs out, it should load the card <filename moreinfo="none">menu</filename>. The timer is defined in the <literal moreinfo="none">timer</literal> element.</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							<literal moreinfo="none">title=&quot;Welcome to ACME&quot;</literal> defines a title to appear at the top of the card in the microbrowser.</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							<literal moreinfo="none">newcontext=&quot;true&quot;</literal> instructs the microbrowser to reset its &apos;context&apos; when the card is loaded. A microbrowser&apos;s context consists of information it holds in its memory about recent events. Specifically, <literal moreinfo="none">newcontext=&quot;true&quot;</literal> removes all WML variables, clears the microbrowser&apos;s navigation history, and resets other information in the microbrower to its default value. precisely what information this is depends on the microbrowser. </para>
					</listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
				<para>The next element is <literal moreinfo="none">timer</literal>. It has the attribute <literal moreinfo="none">value=&quot;30&quot;</literal>, which tells the microbrowser to wait about three seconds before performing the action specified in the card&apos;s <literal moreinfo="none">ontimer</literal> attribute.
</para>
				<para>Note that, because <literal moreinfo="none">timer</literal> is an empty element - that is, one without a closing tag - its tag must end in a forward slash /.
</para>
				<para>The remaining element in the card is <literal moreinfo="none">img</literal>, with three attributes:
</para>
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							<literal moreinfo="none">alt=&quot;ACME corp&quot;</literal> tells the microbrowser to display the text &apos;ACME corp&apos; if it cannot load the image for any reason.
</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							<literal moreinfo="none">src=&quot;acmelogo.wbmp&quot;</literal> tells the microbrowser that the image to be displayed is the file <filename moreinfo="none">acmelogo.wbmp</filename>.
</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							<literal moreinfo="none">align=&quot;middle&quot;</literal> tells the microbrowser to centre the image vertically, in relation to the surrounding text.
</para>
					</listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
				<para>
					<literal moreinfo="none">img</literal>, like <literal moreinfo="none">timer</literal>, is an empty element, so the tag needs a forward slash / at the end of it.
</para>
				<para>Finally, the card ends with a <literal moreinfo="none">&lt;/card&gt;</literal> tag.
</para>
				<para>The second card in the deck looks like this:
</para>
				<programlisting format="linespecific"> &lt;card id=&quot;menu&quot; name=&quot;menu&quot; title=&quot;The ACME Menu&quot;&gt;
  &lt;do type=&quot;prev&quot; label=&quot;ACME home&quot;&gt;
   &lt;prev/&gt;
  &lt;/do&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;info.wml&quot;&gt;
   What is ACME?
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;contact.wml&quot;&gt;
   Contacting ACME
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;employ.wml&quot;&gt;
   ACME Vacancies
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;wpaper.wml&quot;&gt;
   ACME White Paper
  &lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;/card&gt;
</programlisting>
				<para>This is the menu that appeared when the ACME logo card timed out. As you can see, it is a list of hyperlinks to other WML files, with each hyperlink being defined by its own a element.

				<title>12.3 Example Site 3: Perl System Resource Monitor
</title>
				<para>A WAP site does not need to consist just of static WML files: it can also contain scripts that generate WML decks on the fly. To generate WML dynamically, you can use any of the same scripting languages that are available to generate HTML pages on the World Wide Web. All you have to remember is to make your output as concise as possible (less than 3000 characters) and that it needs to be valid WML.
</para>
				<para>One language already widely used for Web scripting is the Practical Extraction and Report Language (Perl). Perl&apos;s powerful text processing capabilities make it equally suitable for WAP scripting.</para>
				<para>You call a WAP script from a mobile device exactly as you would call a Web script from a desktop computer: the relevant URL just has to point to the script file rather than a WML deck. For example, <filename moreinfo="none">http://www.awapsite.net/anyscript.pl</filename> could execute the Perl script <filename moreinfo="none">anyscript.pl</filename> on the WAP site <filename moreinfo="none">http://www.awapsite.net/</filename>. (Of course, the script&apos;s output needs to be in WML, in order to display on a WAP microbrowser.)
</para>
				<para>To download Perl and to find out more about it, visit <filename moreinfo="none">www.perl.com</filename>. Many books are also available on Perl programming.
</para>
				<para>The Alligata Server&apos;s example Perl site retrieves system information from its host machine and sends it in WML format to the client device. Because the information is retrieved using Linux/UNIX commands, the Perl script must be running on a Linux or UNIX operating system.
</para>

				<title>12.4 Example Site 4: PHP System Resource Monitor
</title>
				<para>PHP is a server-side embedded scripting language optimised for use on the World Wide Web. Like Perl, it can be made to generate dynamic output in WML as easily as in HTML. Again, the important thing to remember is that a dynamically generated WML file, like a static WML file, must be less than about 3000 bytes long before compression.
</para>
				<para>PHP is an open source programming language. You can learn about it at the PHP Web site at <ulink url="http://www.php.net">www.php.net</ulink>. This site includes a complete online PHP manual, a Quick Reference Guide and a Frequently Asked Questions page.
</para>
				<para>The Alligata Server package includes two example PHP sites. The first retrieves system information from its host machine&apos;s operating system using the <literal moreinfo="none">uptime</literal> and <literal moreinfo="none">free</literal> Linux/UNIX commands and the PHP <literal moreinfo="none">fsockopen</literal> function.
</para>
				<para>To view the PHP System Resource Monitor, select the link &apos;Sysinfo PHP&apos; from the Site Examples index.

				<title>12.5 Example Site 5: &apos;PAT&apos; PHP Mail
</title>
				<para>The Alligata Server&apos;s second example PHP site, &apos;PAT&apos;, enables you to read your e-mail from a WAP client device. It uses PHP&apos;s IMAP functions to retrieve messages from your e-mail server, embeds them in WML, and sends them to your mobile device. Despite their name, IMAP functions in PHP can be used with protocols other than IMAP, namely POP3, NNTP and local mailbox access methods.
</para>
				<para>Before PAT will work on your system, you need to make one edit to the file <filename moreinfo="none">index.wml</filename> in the directory <filename moreinfo="none">/home/httpd/alligata/wml/dynamic/complex/pat/</filename> (Linux) or <filename moreinfo="none">/opt/TGLBallex/alligata/wml/dynamic/complex/pat/</filename> (Solaris). In the <literal moreinfo="none">&lt;go/&gt;</literal> tag, insert the name of your e-mail server after <literal moreinfo="none">server=</literal>. For example, if your e-mail server is <filename moreinfo="none">imap.asite.net</filename>, the tag should be as follows:
</para>
				<programlisting format="linespecific">&lt;go href=&quot;view.php3?username=$username&amp;amp;password=$passwo
rd&amp;amp;server=imap.asite.net&quot;/&gt;
</programlisting>
				<para>To view the PAT mail site, select the link &apos;PAT: PHP mail&apos; from the Site Examples index. You will see a login card:

</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<para>Before you can set up SMS keyword services or send SMS messages from a computer, you need to create an SMS Box group and an SMSC group in the configuration file (see Section 9). You must also have a subscription to an SMSC or a connection to a GSM modem, as explained in Section 9.3.2. Some example settings are shown in Figure 13.1. </para>

				<title>13.1 Implementing SMS Keyword Services
</title>
				<para>Once you have configured an SMS Box group and an SMSC group in the configuration file, you need to create an SMS Service group for each service you want to implement. An example SMS Service group is shown in Figure 13.2. (See Section 9.3.3 for explanations of the configuration variables.)
</para>

				<programlisting format="linespecific">group = sms-service

				<para>This group sets up an SMS service that returns a proverb from the Web page <filename moreinfo="none">http://www.awebsite.net/potd.html</filename> when it receives the message &apos;proverb&apos; from a mobile device. From the Web page, it retrieves everything between (but not including) the strings <literal moreinfo="none">&lt;!--beginprov--&gt;</literal> and <literal moreinfo="none">&lt;!--endprov--&gt;</literal>. The content of <filename moreinfo="none">potd.html</filename> could look like this:
</para>
				<programlisting format="linespecific"> &lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;SMS proverb of the day&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;

   &lt;!--beginprov--&gt;
   A cat in gloves catches no mice.
   &lt;!--endprov--&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
 &lt;/html&gt;
</programlisting>
				<para>In this case, a user sending the message &apos;proverb&apos; to the Alligata Server would receive the reply message
</para>
				<screen format="linespecific">Today&apos;s proverb -- A cat in gloves catches no mice.
</screen>
				<para>The Alligata Server does not require the prefix and suffix of the message to be in comments <literal moreinfo="none">&lt;!--...--&gt;</literal>, but bear in mind that if they are not, they will be visible in the Web page if it is viewed from a desktop browser.
</para>
				<para>The maximum length of an SMS message is usually 140 or 160 characters (depending on whether it is in 7-bit or 8-bit format). If the text retrieved by the Alligata Server is longer than this limit, the Alligata Server splits it into several messages. To do this, it uses the variables <literal moreinfo="none">split-chars</literal> and <literal moreinfo="none">split-suffix</literal>. The message is split at an occurrence of one of the characters specified in <literal moreinfo="none">split-chars</literal>, and all sections of the message except the last have the text specified in <literal moreinfo="none">split-suffix</literal> appended to them. The Alligata Server splits the message at the nearest previous occurrence of a split character to the maximum message length. For example, suppose the proverb in <filename moreinfo="none">potd.html</filename> is a particularly long one:
</para>
				<programlisting format="linespecific"> &lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;SMS proverb of the day&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot; text=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;
   &lt;!--beginprov--&gt;
   Monday&apos;s child is fair of face, Tuesday&apos;s child is full of grace; Wednesday&apos;s child is full of woe, Thursday&apos;s child has far to go; Friday&apos;s child is loving and giving, Saturday&apos;s child works hard for its living; and the child that is born on the Sabbath day, is fair and wise and good and gay.
   &lt;!--endprov--&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
 &lt;/html&gt;
</programlisting>
				<para>In this instance, the message needs to be split, and the user will probably receive it in three smaller messages:

				<para>The string <literal moreinfo="none">-cont.-</literal> in the first and second messages indicates that they are part of a longer message, more of which is to follow. It is specified using the <literal moreinfo="none">split-suffix</literal> configuration variable.
</para>
				<para>Note that the incoming SMS message must <emphasis role="bold">only</emphasis> contain the keyword, unless the SMS service allows parameters after it. Parameters are discussed in Section 13.1.1.

					<title>13.1.1 SMS Service Parameters
</title>
					<para>The configuration variables <literal moreinfo="none">url, file</literal> and <literal moreinfo="none">text</literal> can include parameters that the Alligata Server substitutes with terms from the incoming message. Each parameter is indicated by a percent character % followed by a letter. The parameters you can use are listed in full in Section 9.3.3.
</para>
					<para>Parameter values should be included in incoming messages after the service keyword, using the following syntax:
</para>
					<para>
						<userinput moreinfo="none">
							<replaceable>keyword parameter#1 parameter#2</replaceable>, etc.
						</userinput>
					</para>
					<para>As an example, suppose your company has created a CGI server application that returns an employee&apos;s salary. You want the Personnel department to be able to gain access to this information from their SMS phones, but no one else. In this case, you could configure the SMS Service group shown in Figure 13.3.
</para>
					<para>Figure 13.3: Example SMS Service group for a salary retrieval application
</para>
					<programlisting format="linespecific">keyword = salary
aliases = Salary;SALARY
url = http://intranet.awebsite.net/cgi/salary?user=%s&amp;password=%s&amp;employee=%r
header = &quot;Salary info -- &quot;</programlisting>
					<para>When the Alligata Server receives an SMS message starting with the keyword &apos;salary&apos; (or one of its aliases), it replaces the first <literal moreinfo="none">%s</literal> in <literal moreinfo="none">url</literal> with the next word in the message after the keyword; replaces the second <literal moreinfo="none">%s</literal> with the next word after that; and replaces the <literal moreinfo="none">%r</literal> with the rest of the message.
</para>
					<para>For example, if the CGI account has the user name <emphasis role="bold">personnel</emphasis> and the password <emphasis role="bold">STARfruit</emphasis>, then a Personnel member can access the salary details of the employee Emma Thompson by sending the Alligata Server the following SMS message:
</para>
					<para>
						<userinput moreinfo="none">
							salary personnel STARfruit emma thompson
						</userinput>
					</para>
					<para>Upon receiving this message, the Alligata Server sends the following HTTP GET request:
</para>
					<para>
						<userinput moreinfo="none">
							 http://intranet.awebsite.net/cgi/salary?user=personnel&amp;
 password=STARfruit&amp;employee=emma+thompson
						</userinput>
					</para>
					<para>When the HTTP reply arrives, the Alligata Server converts it into an SMS message or messages, and sends it back to the Personnel member&apos;s mobile phone.

				<title>13.2 Sending SMS Messages Using HTTP
</title>
				<para>For every user you want to be able to send SMS messages using HTTP, you need to define a Send SMS User group in the configuration file. An example Send SMS User group is shown in Figure 13.4.
</para>
				<para>Figure 13.4: Example Send SMS User group
</para>
				<programlisting format="linespecific">group = sendsms-user
username = colin
password = AVOcado
user-allow-ip = 10.0.0.5
max-messages = 10
split-chars = .;,
split-suffix = -cont.-
header = &quot;Msg from Colin -- &quot;</programlisting>
				<para>This configuration group allows the user <emphasis role="bold">colin</emphasis> with the password <emphasis role="bold">AVOcado</emphasis> to send SMS messages from the IP address 10.0.0.5. As with SMS keyword services, outgoing messages that are over the maximum length of a single SMS message can be split into several smaller messages, up to the maximum specified in <literal moreinfo="none">max-messages</literal>. The variables <literal moreinfo="none">split-chars, split-suffix</literal> and <literal moreinfo="none">header</literal> work exactly as in SMS Service groups (see Section 13.1).
</para>
				<para>
					<userinput moreinfo="none">http://<replaceable>hostname:port</replaceable>/cgi-bin/sendsms?username=<replaceable>username</replaceable>&amp;password=<replaceable>password</replaceable>&amp;from=<replaceable>sender&apos;s_number</replaceable>&amp;to=<replaceable>receiver&apos;s_number</replaceable>&amp;text=<replaceable>message_text</replaceable>
					</userinput>
				</para>
				<para>The elements in bold italic type should be replaced with the relevant information. For example:
</para>
				<para>
					<userinput moreinfo="none">

All+sales+staff+return+to+office+immediately
					</userinput>
				</para>
				<para>The URL should contain no carriage returns and no spaces. Spaces in the message should be represented by plus signs +. 
</para>
				<section>
					<title>13.2.1 User Data Headers (<literal moreinfo="none">udh</literal> parameter)
</title>
					<para>An SMS message can include a <emphasis role="bold">user data header (UDH)</emphasis> that contains non-textual information for use by a mobile phone. For example, a UDH can tell a phone to handle the main body of the message in a particular way, such as storing it as a ring tone or as a graphical image to appear when the phone is switched on. For information on the format of UDH messages for a particular phone, consult the phone&apos;s documentation or visit the manufacturer&apos;s Web site.
</para>
					<para>When you send an SMS message from a computer workstation using HTTP, you can include a UDH by using the optional <literal moreinfo="none">udh</literal> parameter. For example:
</para>
					<para>
						<userinput moreinfo="none">
							http://localhost:13013/cgi-bin/sendsms?username=colin&amp;
password=AVOcado&amp;from=0999666666&amp;to=0898999999&amp;text=
%52%62%1a%bb%31%0d%21%84%77%ba%f7%f2&amp;udh=%31%a7%99%f3%80%db
						</userinput>
					</para>
					<para>All non-alphanumeric characters in the message text and the UDH value must be in hexadecimal format and preceded by a percent sign %.
 </para>
				</section>
				<section>
					<title>13.2.2  <literal moreinfo="none">smsc</literal> Parameter
</title>
					<para>You can use the optional smsc parameter to force an SMS message to be sent via a particular SMSC. The smsc parameter should have the value set by the <literal moreinfo="none">smsc-id</literal> variable in the relevant SMSC group of the configuration file (see Section 9.3.2). For example:
</para>
					<para>
						<userinput moreinfo="none">
							http://localhost:13013/cgi-bin/sendsms?username=colin&amp;
password=AVOcado&amp;from=0999666666&amp;to=0898999999&amp;text=

					<title>13.2.3 SMS Messaging Using HTML Forms
</title>
					<para>Typing complex URLs into a browser&apos;s &apos;Location&apos; box can be tedious, and if you expect to be sending a lot of SMS messages, it is worth creating an HTML form for the task. Use the HTTP GET method, and define variables in HTML input objects. Constant values can be embedded in hidden objects. Variable names should be specified in the name attributes of the relevant elements, and the corresponding values in <literal moreinfo="none">value</literal> attributes. For example:
</para>
					<programlisting format="linespecific"> &lt;html&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;

				<title>13.3 Over-the-air (OTA) Configuration of WAP Client Devices Using SMS
</title>
				<para>Changing the settings for a WAP service provider from a mobile device can be laborious, with up to a dozen variables to alter on each device. If you are a system administrator needing to configure all your company&apos;s WAP phones to the same service, the process becomes particularly time-consuming. However, the Alligata Server allows you to automate device configuration by defining automatic WAP service settings in the configuration file. By sending a single SMS-format message to each phone from a computer workstation, you can add a whole configuration to its settings. It is also possible for the user of a client device to invoke the OTA configuration themselves. This enables a user to add WAP services to their mobile phone with a minimum of effort.
</para>
				<para>The Alligata Server&apos;s OTA configuration feature is currently known to work on the Nokia 7110, Nokia 6210 and Nokia 9110i phones.
</para>
				<para>In order to implement OTA configuration, you need to set up three configuration groups in the configuration file:
</para>
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>
						<para>an OTA Configuration group, containing the settings to be sent to the client device
</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>a Send SMS User group, setting up a user account for sending of OTA messages 
</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>an SMS Service group, pointing to the Alligata Server&apos;s <literal moreinfo="none">sendota</literal> CGI application
</para>
					</listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
				<para>For details of configuration groups and variables, see Section 9.
</para>
				<para>An example set of configuration groups for OTA configuration is shown in Figure 13.6.
